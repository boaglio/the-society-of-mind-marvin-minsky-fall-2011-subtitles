8
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:26,760
What are the biggest problems that the world faces,

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,960
and what should we be doing to solve them?

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,880
It started with some conversation

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,920
about global warming and climate change,

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,680
or whatever you want to call it.

13
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:48,560
And this friend of mine likes to organize meetings.

14
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:54,720
And he said, well, that looks like a real disaster

15
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,120
in the next 50 years.

16
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:02,040
And maybe the ocean will rise two or five meters.

17
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:07,000
And that will remove the habitat of 20%

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
of all the people in the world.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
They'll all move somewhere else.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,720
And the places that they move will already

21
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:18,800
be full of people, because we're talking about 2050 or 60.

22
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:23,720
And there will be various arguments

23
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:30,840
about the few resources left on the planet.

24
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,080
So we were talking about that a little bit.

25
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,200
And then the question came up.

26
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:41,680
Well, maybe that's just one of a dozen other disasters.

27
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,440
And so I started cataloging possible disasters.

28
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:52,960
And anyway, this philanthropist said, well,

29
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,000
let's have a conference to discuss that.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,960
And if we can find some serious problem

31
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,440
that nobody has noticed, and so on and so forth.

32
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,000
So what do you think?

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,800
Now, during the period when AI looked

34
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,360
like it was progressing rapidly, lots of people

35
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,000
got panicked and went into science fiction mode

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:32,000
and said, well, what if the two novels I found very impressive,

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,960
one was Colossus by an English writer named D.F. Jones.

38
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:41,000
Any of you read that?

39
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:46,000
It became a movie called The Forbin Project.

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,320
Movie wasn't terribly good.

41
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:53,280
But the thesis was that if you started fooling around with AI

42
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,120
and you got really fast supercomputers,

43
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,320
then maybe the thing would start evolving.

44
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,640
Because if you can't solve a problem, what do you do?

45
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,520
You try a lot of things, and then you

46
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:13,720
see which of them seem to be leading to some improvement.

47
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,160
And then you collect the programs

48
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,720
that seem to make a little progress

49
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,560
and mix their parts and recombine them.

50
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:29,080
And in fact, maybe half a dozen projects in the last 50 years

51
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,820
have been people who said, oh, instead

52
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,600
of trying to program an intelligent machine,

53
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,960
why don't we just evolve one by generating

54
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,840
lots of random code and giving it problems

55
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,480
and selecting the ones that work and taking pieces of their DNA

56
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,880
and recombining them?

57
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,160
And there's about a dozen such programs,

58
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,200
and I don't think I could remember them all.

59
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,440
Larry Fogel had one.

60
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:03,120
So if you look up, I think it's F-O-G-E-L.

61
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:13,840
And to make a short story even shorter, all of them

62
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,760
showed signs of progress and then flattened out.

63
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,840
The most impressive one was the, I think I mentioned them

64
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,120
briefly, by Lenat, Douglas Lenat.

65
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:32,360
And he had the one that he set toward discovering mathematics.

66
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:38,840
And it was a set of list programs.

67
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,240
So there's a list function, which

68
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,080
was the length of a list, which means that list

69
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,280
can represent numbers a little bit.

70
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,480
Can represent numbers a little bit.

71
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:59,720
And this program called Automated Mathematician

72
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:04,200
computed various functions of sets and would make new sets.

73
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:08,640
And that's the one that discovered prime numbers,

74
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,160
except that it concluded that nine

75
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,280
was a prime for some reason.

76
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,320
But that didn't bother it much, because then

77
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:24,400
it invented all sorts of other elementary mathematical

78
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,160
processes.

79
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,800
And of course, every now and then,

80
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,320
it would get something wrong.

81
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,520
But who cares?

82
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,840
If it got a lot of them right, it would reward it and so on.

83
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,160
Anyway, it flattened out.

84
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,960
I think I told this story the other day.

85
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:46,680
Later, he won this contest of simulated naval engagements,

86
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:55,480
which the Naval War College had an annual contest.

87
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:59,320
How do you program a fleet to defeat another fleet?

88
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:07,000
And Lenat's fleet, I did tell that.

89
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,280
A fleet can only go as fast as its slowest ship.

90
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,040
So Lenat's fleet, unlike all the others,

91
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,840
turned its guns backwards and sunk its slowest ship

92
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,160
repeatedly.

93
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,800
And this enabled it to win all the battles,

94
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:28,000
because the other people who had been to Naval War College

95
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,280
spent a lot of time writing programs that

96
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,000
would defend their weakest ship.

97
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,960
I'm not sure what the moral of that is.

98
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,200
If you're fighting a war, you have

99
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,240
to change your ordinary value system.

100
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,280
Anyway, of course, at the same time,

101
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,000
there were lots of people who took these scenarios seriously

102
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:02,680
and said the AI and this whole group of them today called,

103
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,760
they say they're doing research on how to make friendly AIs.

104
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,040
And I regard this as exceedingly comical,

105
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,200
because they don't know how to make anything

106
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:18,800
as smart as an 18-month-old child or your favorite dog.

107
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:28,280
However, the scenario in the Colossus novel

108
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,480
is that, yes, progress is slow for a while,

109
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:35,400
but then suddenly it goes from being good at something

110
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,920
to getting control of all the other computers in the world

111
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,460
in the next 15 minutes, including another one

112
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:47,360
in Russia, which by some remarkable coincidence

113
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,880
has also become smart around the same time.

114
00:07:50,880 --> 00:08:01,120
And then Colossus, which is the name of D.F. Jones' computer.

115
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,320
Forbin is the programmer who started the project.

116
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,480
The movie didn't use the word Colossus,

117
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:16,320
because it's probably not in the average person's vocabulary.

118
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,440
Anyway, Colossus suddenly decides

119
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,680
that it's not smart enough.

120
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:37,680
And so it orders the English government

121
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,960
to clear off one of the Channel Islands,

122
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,920
and it's going to build a bigger copy of itself.

123
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,480
That'll be smarter.

124
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,160
And Forbin asks why, and Colossus says,

125
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,140
because I've been analyzing signals

126
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:55,120
from extraterrestrial sources.

127
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,080
And there's a really smart machine coming here,

128
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,240
and it's going to kill all of us.

129
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,720
And so I have to build a machine that's a million times

130
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,400
smarter than I am so that we'll be able to.

131
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,280
And so on.

132
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:13,480
So there's a typical scenario, and the friendly AI people

133
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:19,360
say, how can we make sure that one of the AI projects

134
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,840
won't suddenly take over the world

135
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,280
and have some paranoid fantasy about why

136
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,000
it has to kill all the people to make

137
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,080
it safe for the next generation of beings?

138
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,360
Science fiction writers are good at thinking.

139
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,480
So I'm asking you to think of other disasters.

140
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,680
What's the worst disaster you can think of?

141
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,520
Oh, well, next to worst.

142
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,280
I have one, but I don't know if it's the worst case.

143
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,720
There's actually a movie that someone represented

144
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,520
in this case.

145
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,160
Have you seen the movie Idiocracy?

146
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:55,760
Yes.

147
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,360
Yeah, with the society and like, what happened afterwards.

148
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,640
That's what happens afterwards.

149
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,280
Yeah.

150
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,240
So it sort of makes me wonder if there,

151
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,280
you see this to some extent now where people have systems

152
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,160
that augment some of the things they

153
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,760
used to do so much that they stop paying attention to

154
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:14,120
or stop learning some of the stuff they used to.

155
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,400
I can't remember that when it began,

156
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:20,000
but you end up with a world where somebody, they're

157
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,920
starving and somebody says, well,

158
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,640
I think there's something called seeds,

159
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,080
and if you plant them, you.

160
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,760
Exactly.

161
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,920
They're watering their plants with gator in one part

162
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,600
because it has a lot of plants.

163
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,160
But I think maybe one problem is that you might start

164
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:41,800
to see a big divide between people who are increasingly

165
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,120
relying on technology to be able to learn nothing

166
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,040
and people who take advantage of technology to learn a lot.

167
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,160
So maybe there will be this sort of divide in the future,

168
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,200
people who know a lot and are very smart and intelligent,

169
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,240
people who just don't or don't have the motivation to.

170
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:02,440
And then the problem becomes, who takes care of who

171
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,000
and how does that work?

172
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,120
Do you try and get people to be more motivated or?

173
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,920
Well, there is this weird phenomenon

174
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:17,920
that could happen again, which is a nice question of,

175
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,640
why did science stop with Archimedes

176
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:29,680
and not pick up again till Galileo or?

177
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,520
So there's anybody have a theory?

178
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:39,360
Why did progress stop?

179
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:46,800
And one popular theory is that the rise of religions.

180
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,200
But of course, as far as we know,

181
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,080
there were always religions.

182
00:11:50,080 --> 00:12:01,400
How come Christianity and Islam had such a powerful effect

183
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:05,200
for so much of the world for how long?

184
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,000
And is there a chance somebody could just

185
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,400
invent another one tomorrow that would spread through and wipe

186
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,880
out everything?

187
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,480
And how do you detect it and stop it

188
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,000
before it starts to spread?

189
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:24,280
But so that's something that could happen.

190
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,120
It's happened before.

191
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:34,360
Or suppose somebody invented a new kind

192
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,400
of not quite sound logical argument

193
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:42,080
that convinces everyone, which would be almost the same thing,

194
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,600
I suppose.

195
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,880
Have we been just lucky that nobody

196
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,280
thought of a false argument that you

197
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,720
can use to convince anybody of anything?

198
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,760
Well, maybe we have protection mechanisms

199
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:06,560
against something like that happening.

200
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,560
As for the first day.

201
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,000
You mean it used to happen, and a few people developed,

202
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,720
evolved a way to reject it.

203
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,640
And now it's so common that we don't even know about it.

204
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,160
I don't know.

205
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:21,800
Can you imagine?

206
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,720
What is it like?

207
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,720
If something is very convincing, you get this feeling,

208
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,320
well, that promise is too much.

209
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,560
I'll ignore it.

210
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,240
That could be.

211
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:41,160
That's why we turn down when thesis proposals get rejected.

212
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,480
Sometimes it's because they don't promise enough,

213
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,000
but usually it's because they're going to solve everything.

214
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,600
And then the thesis advisor says,

215
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,480
well, here's this little problem.

216
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,880
Can you solve that?

217
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,440
And the student goes away.

218
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,200
And if we're lucky, they come back

219
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:05,120
with something that'll solve that instead of everything.

220
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,560
I think it's all happening again right now.

221
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,440
Essentially, when the economy collapses,

222
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,440
then people have to worry about other things.

223
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,160
So their attention is elsewhere.

224
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,240
The Visigoth at the gate are eating.

225
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,000
Look at what's happening now with the economies.

226
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,560
There are theories that are proven to be pretty bad,

227
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,200
and they're bringing everything down.

228
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,320
Do you think that we fall about more theories

229
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,240
or practical action?

230
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,280
Let's see.

231
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:45,360
Is this one worse than the 1929 depression?

232
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,320
That got most of the world, didn't it?

233
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,560
It did.

234
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,640
Not yet.

235
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,520
It's not quite there.

236
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,000
But it's much worse.

237
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,080
Because Argentina and a few other countries

238
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,600
don't seem to have collapsed yet.

239
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,200
Back then, we had the gold standard.

240
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,160
Now we only have the paper money standard.

241
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,160
So they're shoring up the walls, but when it falls,

242
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,640
it's going to be very bad indeed.

243
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,840
Didn't gold hit $3,000 recently?

244
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,880
It was over $2,000.

245
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,480
Yeah?

246
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:24,000
When people start not trusting the currency anymore,

247
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,680
like the main currency, because the currency is just

248
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,360
a contract.

249
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,480
And so if you don't trust anymore the people that

250
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:39,000
bring the currency, then we can have countries who will not

251
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,520
be as organized as before.

252
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:47,280
Because why should that be poor if there is wealth?

253
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:52,640
Well, of course, that's why people are going to gold.

254
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:57,080
I'm not sure they're going to gold for security.

255
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,280
I think they're just trying to make more money.

256
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,200
But who knows?

257
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,120
Well, how do you fix an economic depression?

258
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:13,320
I believe World War II helped.

259
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,120
That may be the solution again.

260
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,280
So I guess, positively, it is a disaster.

261
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:23,400
I would say that the collective archive of human information

262
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,320
and knowledge becomes more and more important.

263
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,760
The collective archive of human information and knowledge

264
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,840
becomes so polluted with bullshit

265
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,200
that you can no longer find an actual useful fact

266
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:39,040
among the propaganda.

267
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:50,840
Well, then there are pretty soon high school students

268
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:54,000
will be able to make new genomes.

269
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,160
They can do it.

270
00:16:55,200 --> 00:17:02,320
So that's a typical technological disaster that

271
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:09,920
did you read the paper last week that some lab made

272
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:14,840
the best smallpox virus ever?

273
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:15,760
Yeah.

274
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,440
But you can have agencies that control that.

275
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:23,440
I mean, there are many kinds of weapons

276
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,800
that you can create at home.

277
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,560
The fact that you can create them

278
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,040
doesn't mean that people are going to create them.

279
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,800
And you just need to create them.

280
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,000
But if you have 7 billion people and you only

281
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:44,080
need one to create the smallpox that kills everybody,

282
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,800
it doesn't take any.

283
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:51,360
These machines will be $1,000 soon.

284
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,320
How much does a sequencer?

285
00:17:54,320 --> 00:18:02,560
Well, you have to buy the DNA bottles.

286
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:09,760
Might cost several dollars to make the ultimate virus.

287
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,520
Why don't people sell these machines?

288
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,800
They are.

289
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:18,920
They've just gotten cheap enough that you can buy one.

290
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,000
We're just on the, they used to cost

291
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
a million dollars, but now there's

292
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:30,080
a place down on what's the street after Vassar Street?

293
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,200
Albany Street.

294
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,360
Company there that has sequencers,

295
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,720
which are only $50,000.

296
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,520
Can people control the spread of a disease,

297
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,360
like, for example, the swine flu?

298
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,400
They don't know how to stop AIDS after 30 years

299
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,680
of well-funded research.

300
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,560
Yeah, but we still have a lot of people.

301
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:55,640
So if one billion people die, it's just one billion.

302
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,320
I mean, it's a large number.

303
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,240
You see, it might kill everybody in a year,

304
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,560
and it takes five years to make a new drug.

305
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:09,160
So it's a sort of, I don't think there's

306
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:16,360
an answer to that one right now, except that right now you

307
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,880
get a prize if you synthesize something.

308
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:34,360
Tom Knight had some high school students

309
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,920
make interesting things.

310
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:40,320
But there are lots of projects like that now,

311
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,760
where people in biology courses can design something

312
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,320
and get it onto a gene-making machine.

313
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,960
So that's a serious problem.

314
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,600
Yeah?

315
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:00,240
We have these big problems, and we have other several ones.

316
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,840
We are not very smart, as in videos.

317
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:08,120
And also, we can't communicate very well, very fast.

318
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,640
And probably we need machines that

319
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,640
can solve these problems for us.

320
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,280
Do you believe that Brooke's approach

321
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:21,520
of solving creating robots, like intelligent robots, is good?

322
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:26,040
And how is it compared to Winston's approach?

323
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,080
He's doing more research and trying

324
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:33,440
to create something, I believe, more similar to a human being

325
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,120
than a human intelligent?

326
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,640
Well, he's trying to make a machine that

327
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,920
can do common-sense reasoning, what we

328
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:45,040
call common-sense reasoning.

329
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:48,600
Yeah, but do you think that's better,

330
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:55,000
because we will solve problems like the problem of having

331
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,560
people that produce viruses very cheap?

332
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,880
Then these robots can solve these problems for us,

333
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,440
probably, if they're smarter than us,

334
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,560
if they have enough processors.

335
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,040
Do you think that's better than creating, like, for example,

336
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:15,760
Brooks is creating robots that solve other problems?

337
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:24,840
Well, that's a question of whether can you

338
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,720
make a machine that's very good at some?

339
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,080
I mean, there are things like mathematical problems,

340
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,480
like factoring numbers.

341
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,840
And you could make a supercomputer.

342
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,080
Nobody has.

343
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,560
But you could imagine working on that problem

344
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:51,000
and eventually finding some way to make a computer factor

345
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,600
very large numbers quickly.

346
00:21:53,600 --> 00:22:00,440
Now, nobody has proved that that's a NP problem, as far as it.

347
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,920
Does anybody know?

348
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:07,360
Is factoring an NP-hard problem?

349
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,360
It has not been shown to be NP-hard.

350
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:09,840
What?

351
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,800
It has not been shown to be NP-hard.

352
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,360
Recently, there's a 2002 paper that

353
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:18,560
proved that factoring showed a polynomial algorithm

354
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:23,560
for factoring, like, recently, in 2002.

355
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,720
It's been shown to be polynomial?

356
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,880
That's nice.

357
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,160
Or not, I don't know.

358
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:28,660
Oh.

359
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,520
I haven't kept track.

360
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,960
Oh, no, no, no.

361
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,440
That's if something's hard.

362
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,240
Oh, yeah.

363
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,240
Yeah, that's amazing.

364
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,560
Yeah, I think the problem right now

365
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:48,320
is they don't think it's NP-hard.

366
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,280
But if it turns out to be polynomial,

367
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:55,400
like, the entire hierarchy kind of collapses,

368
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,480
I think that's what happens.

369
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,080
But, yeah, it's weird.

370
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:04,480
There are known to be problems that are not polynomial.

371
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:12,560
And but what's the standard NP problem, Mike?

372
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,060
Sad.

373
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,360
Free-sad.

374
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,080
Which one?

375
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,080
Free-sad.

376
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,560
Sad.

377
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,040
Boolean satisfiability.

378
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,920
Boolean satisfiability.

379
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:28,840
Friedberg and Mucznik had a complicated process

380
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,000
between where two Turing machines are

381
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,240
passing data to each other.

382
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:38,160
And they proved that that was NP,

383
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:43,000
but simpler than the standard one.

384
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,240
So there are things on the hierarchy

385
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:52,240
that are lower than the combinatorial standard ones.

386
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:57,360
But anyway, the question is, can you

387
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:03,000
make a machine that can understand Shakespeare plays,

388
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,360
but that leaves no possibility that 10 minutes later,

389
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:12,800
it can do unthinkably dangerous things?

390
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,240
And I think the answer is no.

391
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,000
Nobody.

392
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,040
It's hard to see any difference between literary thinking

393
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,440
and scientific thinking.

394
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,720
I mean, a novel is like a very long proof

395
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:33,600
of something with a few bugs.

396
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,520
I don't see general literature as any different

397
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:43,280
from technical literature, except the criterion for success

398
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,240
is much lower.

399
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:55,160
I made a whole list of things, but I

400
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,400
don't know if that thing works.

401
00:24:59,280 --> 00:24:59,760
Wake up.

402
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:06,440
Well, my screen is blue.

403
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,120
It may actually.

404
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,360
Is it actually working?

405
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,040
Oh, I could.

406
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:32,040
Is there any point in my turning on the control panel?

407
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,600
Turning on the control panel.

408
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,160
Oh, well, maybe the connector is looser.

409
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,440
Oh, well.

410
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,760
It doesn't have any diagrams.

411
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:15,680
I mean, we already have problems that look pretty serious,

412
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:22,760
like when people started worrying about population,

413
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,800
when people started worrying about population

414
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:31,800
a generation ago, it was carefully explained

415
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:39,680
that as soon as people achieved a substantial income,

416
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:44,200
then the number of children per family would disappear.

417
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,960
And I don't know if that rumor is still.

418
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,960
How many of you believe that as the standard of living

419
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,480
goes up, the population declines?

420
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:00,200
Seems to be true in some countries,

421
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,560
but it only takes one exception.

422
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,160
Yeah?

423
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:08,760
I always thought it was more correlated to education

424
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:13,280
about methods of inventing.

425
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:17,760
Well, if you don't get married until you get your PhD,

426
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:27,680
and if we manage to make the PhD take 15 years,

427
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,040
has anybody proposed that?

428
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,280
And I feel like part of it with developing countries

429
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,400
where standards of living are low,

430
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,360
one of the reasons why population is so high

431
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:44,120
is that they don't really have good methods of birth control.

432
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:48,800
It's not necessarily that they want to be having so many kids,

433
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:54,240
but it's just that they have fewer methods of preventing it.

434
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,560
There's also if you have seven kids and four of them die,

435
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:03,280
then you say, oh, what am I going to do when I retire?

436
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:06,840
And so you quickly have four more if you can.

437
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,360
Right, so I guess they are accounting for the fact

438
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,280
that a lot of kids are likely to die in childhood.

439
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:18,840
Anyway, but once you have robots, then we won't need kids anymore.

440
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,840
Like in Japan?

441
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,000
What's happening in Japan?

442
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,680
The birth rate is way down.

443
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,640
Well, I think in Japan, they have a problem

444
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,840
with an aging population and not enough young people

445
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,760
to take care of them.

446
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:34,680
So I think they're investing a lot in humanoid robots or robots

447
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,960
that can take care of old people.

448
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:42,400
Yes, I see the Honda robot has gotten a little smaller

449
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,880
and doesn't fall over quite so quickly.

450
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,840
Have you seen it dance?

451
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:49,200
It's pretty cute.

452
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:54,960
There's something wrong with its posture, though, because apparently

453
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,720
it doesn't know.

454
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,200
It can't straighten its legs without falling over.

455
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:04,560
So it's always it's watching.

456
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,680
Anybody know why?

457
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:10,400
Maybe it doesn't have any spinal joints.

458
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:18,960
Anyway, cars can't walk yet.

459
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,640
So what other disasters do we?

460
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,640
Well, there's always global warming.

461
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,640
That looks hard to fix.

462
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:39,120
Yeah, there's a lot of people who want to fix it.

463
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,840
I have a friend named Russell Seitz who

464
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,440
appears to have a good solution to it, which

465
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:47,360
is terribly simple.

466
00:29:47,360 --> 00:30:00,680
And it turns out that if you have an ocean

467
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:14,440
and you make little bubbles by, you

468
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:19,720
have a tube running in back of a ship, and it has little holes.

469
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:23,120
And if you make micron-sized bubbles,

470
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:31,320
then they turn the water white because the interface

471
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:35,040
between water and air is a change of refractive index.

472
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,560
And that reflects a lot of light.

473
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:42,120
And it turns out that if you do that in distilled water,

474
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,960
the bubbles go away pretty quickly

475
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:49,760
because the smaller a bubble is, the higher the pressure inside.

476
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,760
Everybody know why?

477
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:58,600
Because surface tension is constant on the boundary.

478
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:03,640
So the pressure is proportional to the curvature

479
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:06,600
because the smaller the bubble is,

480
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:13,000
the greater the force per square inch of surface to pull it in.

481
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,400
But in seawater, there's enough oils and other things

482
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:20,520
in any cubic centimeter of seawater

483
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:26,200
to coat a micron-sized bubble with an oily film

484
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,680
or one that doesn't let the air out of the bubble.

485
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,520
So the bubble is good for several hours.

486
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:36,760
And the bubble tends to float up to the top,

487
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,600
stay in the top few inches of water.

488
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:44,080
And if there's a wave, it goes down, but it comes up again.

489
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:48,960
So his calculations show that if you have a few thousand ships,

490
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:53,840
which at any time in crossing the Atlantic, for example,

491
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,880
there are a few thousand ships, and each of them

492
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:01,400
is producing a half mile wide streak of whiteness

493
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:06,240
that lasts a few hours, then you can

494
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,080
change the reflectivity of that part of the Earth

495
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:16,240
by 2% or 3% at very low energy cost.

496
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,600
And the nice thing is if it doesn't work, you turn it off.

497
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,640
Some of the plans are to put sulfur dioxide

498
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,120
into the upper atmosphere.

499
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:30,000
And if it doesn't work, you can't

500
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,960
do anything for a few years.

501
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:40,440
So there's a fairly expensive, but not seriously expensive,

502
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,800
possible solution.

503
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:45,240
And it took him three or four years

504
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,240
to convince anybody of it, and now the idea

505
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,440
might be catching on.

506
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,400
But every now and then somebody invents something

507
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:56,640
that actually works, and that's a possibility.

508
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,120
Maybe you can invent something.

509
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:11,600
Painting roofs white also works, but there aren't enough of them.

510
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,960
And you might have to clean them every now and then.

511
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,600
Maybe it's time to reconsider laser powered volcano

512
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,560
landings amid huge amounts of particulate matter

513
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:29,960
to the atmosphere by controlled volcanic emission.

514
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:35,000
Yes, well, it was in 1883.

515
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,920
Pumatile or Krakatoa.

516
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,280
Krakatoa.

517
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:43,480
It was the year without a summer all over the world

518
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:47,440
from one gigantic explosion.

519
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,840
So it happened again this year thanks to Greenland.

520
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:51,360
What's that?

521
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,200
They're about to have a major eruption in Greenland.

522
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,760
Oh, do you think it'll help, or is it just going

523
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,760
to warm the water up a little?

524
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:03,640
No, they estimate this one may shut down air traffic over Europe

525
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,760
for two years.

526
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,040
Well, people shouldn't travel anyway.

527
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:13,440
Why don't they just use the internet and Twitter?

528
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,640
Well, they tend to be where the jet confinals are not

529
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:18,280
too much different from the boat bubbles.

530
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,200
It would take a lot of airplanes, but yes.

531
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:26,240
Nobody knows if these bubbles would have a bad effect,

532
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:29,840
but it's hard to.

533
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:33,400
But the nice thing is you could turn them off in a few hours.

534
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:47,600
He's gotten some attention from people

535
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:54,560
who want to conserve water in the Colorado basin and places.

536
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:58,040
For better or for worse, there's nobody in charge of the Earth.

537
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:01,720
So nobody wants to spend any money on that

538
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:04,120
unless they can get their money back.

539
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:18,040
I have lots of disasters, but I want a new one.

540
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:22,040
So do you believe in global warming?

541
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,840
Oh, well, that is happening now.

542
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:29,520
The Chinese say it's global cooling until 2068.

543
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:35,840
Well, somebody might be right, but as far

544
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:40,120
as I know, all the big simulations

545
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:46,360
claim to get a degree per decade or something, don't they?

546
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:53,880
The Western models tend to underestimate

547
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:58,280
the role of the sun in it, so things like the Maunder

548
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,840
minimum of its impact coming.

549
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,200
That was 300 years or something?

550
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,040
Yes.

551
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,920
Well, if you knew how to turn that on, that would help.

552
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,840
Well, we seem to be going into a solar minimum

553
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:16,960
now where there is low flux and sunspots, but no major effects.

554
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,680
There are no sunspots this year.

555
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,160
Nobody knows why.

556
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,320
Well, a few people know why, but nobody

557
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,640
knows which ones they are.

558
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,560
Well, it's the end of the Mayan calendar.

559
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,400
Of which?

560
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,400
The Mayan calendar.

561
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,520
Now, look at it.

562
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,440
They didn't have it.

563
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,320
What's the next year?

564
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:36,820
2012.

565
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:37,320
Oh, yeah.

566
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,400
It's like December.

567
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,240
Oh, next year.

568
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,960
Is there just one copy?

569
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,280
I think I've seen it somewhere.

570
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:51,240
It's in Yucatan when I was a kid.

571
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:01,120
And they explained that the, oh, never mind.

572
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:04,600
Human sacrifice place.

573
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,300
But it worked.

574
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:09,880
Everybody makes fun of human sacrifice, but here we are.

575
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:39,800
Is it going up?

576
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,720
Doesn't matter.

577
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,200
I'm just looking at my notes.

578
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,440
So is there anything when you release that will

579
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,440
be cured by making smarter people?

580
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:02,620
Hm.

581
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,000
What if they didn't agree?

582
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,800
If people were really smart, then they would agree.

583
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,280
Is that possible?

584
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,280
I don't know.

585
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,960
I don't know what it means.

586
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:23,640
I don't either.

587
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,140
OK.

588
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,640
Well, that's a serious question.

589
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:36,200
I mean, what do you think people should

590
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:41,720
work on if you were going to do a PhD thesis on AI?

591
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:45,840
What would you aim toward?

592
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:53,560
And recently, we had a student who

593
00:38:53,560 --> 00:39:04,320
had decided for some reason to imagine a commonsensical

594
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,160
kitchen project.

595
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:14,280
So the point was, the idea was that, as you know,

596
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:18,840
various projects, including at MIT,

597
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:22,200
are collecting commonsensical knowledge about the world

598
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,800
and trying to make programs and do reasoning about it.

599
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:32,560
Henry Lieberman's project here is

600
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,640
the most famous one is the Psyche project

601
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,920
that I mentioned before.

602
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,560
It's the same Lenat fellow.

603
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:46,200
After he wrote these early AI programs that

604
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:51,280
solved mathematical problems and simulated evolution

605
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:55,200
and little things like that, then he

606
00:39:55,200 --> 00:40:01,200
decided that he was going to do a PhD thesis on AI.

607
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:05,960
And you couldn't really have a smart machine

608
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:10,080
unless it knew a lot, because it might take 1,000 years

609
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:17,600
to accumulate knowledge just by doing experiments.

610
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,920
So I think Lenat was the first one

611
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:26,240
to start accumulating a large commonsense knowledge base.

612
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:32,760
And I imagine that that current project may still

613
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,800
be the largest one.

614
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,480
I don't know.

615
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:43,320
Psyche is short for encyclopedia or something.

616
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:52,320
And so we did have a student who said, well,

617
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:56,480
here's a nice, quiet world, the kitchen world.

618
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:00,000
And you want to make something that has certain properties.

619
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,760
So you have to figure out what ingredients

620
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,680
and how long to cook them.

621
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:07,840
Or you have a knowledge base with recipes.

622
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:13,080
And then if somebody wants something new, you.

623
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,600
So that's a typical project.

624
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:19,360
And several of us talked to that student out of it

625
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:33,240
or managed to, because we didn't see any chance

626
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:38,720
of the colossus disaster coming.

627
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,240
It's almost the opposite.

628
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:46,000
I keep getting messages from the friendly AI society.

629
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:51,760
And there exists a bunch of apparently smart people

630
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,880
who are saying, how can we do AI research

631
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:58,520
without the risk of making a machine that suddenly becomes

632
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:02,760
very smart and takes over the world and kills everybody?

633
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:09,640
And they write all these papers about ways to make friendly AI.

634
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:14,480
And they have discussion groups where somebody

635
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,600
proposes such a thing.

636
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:21,960
And somebody else points out five obvious bugs in that.

637
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:26,000
And these people are pretty serious.

638
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,560
Just look up friendly AI on your browser.

639
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,060
Yes?

640
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:34,720
AUDIENCE MEMBER 3 Do you think that sort of terminator Hollywood

641
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:38,200
movie scenes in the scenario is a legitimate concern?

642
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,400
MARVIN MINSKY Yes.

643
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:42,800
I think there are a lot of.

644
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:48,920
I think the smallpox, the 100% lethal smallpox

645
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:52,080
is what this one was advertised as.

646
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:55,920
How many of you saw the press release on that?

647
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,400
Three or four.

648
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,480
It killed all the mice.

649
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:06,720
I think it was 12 mice.

650
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:11,400
But there might have been something else in their food.

651
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:14,120
Who knows?

652
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,840
Yes, I think it's a serious problem.

653
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:22,480
And it would be great if somebody in that group

654
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:26,000
actually got a good idea about how to look,

655
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,240
how to detect these troubles before they spread.

656
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,800
I just don't recommend any of you

657
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:35,520
to work on it for your thesis or something,

658
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,360
because I don't think there's a good answer.

659
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:47,080
See, if it gets smarter than all the people put together

660
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:52,080
in five minutes, then nothing we've thought of could stop it.

661
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:57,040
But I need something different from a smallpox virus.

662
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,040
It's a self-governing sort of entity.

663
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:03,880
It's very hard to.

664
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:15,040
Well, in the Colossus novel, which is quite well worked out,

665
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:21,120
the machine says, this creature from outer space is coming.

666
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:24,280
And from its behavior, you can see

667
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:26,960
that it's a really super intelligent thing.

668
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,840
It's really dangerous.

669
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:33,800
And so I have to get the people to support me

670
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:38,760
to figure out some way.

671
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,520
I mean, how do you stop a thing that's

672
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:45,880
coming at almost the speed of light and blah, blah, blah?

673
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:48,720
Maybe the only solution is to change physics.

674
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,120
So you have to think of some very,

675
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:53,480
once you understand physics very well,

676
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:55,760
maybe you can turn a switch and change

677
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:59,200
the gravitational constant and so forth.

678
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:02,040
And if you start fooling around with that,

679
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:05,040
then there's probably only one chance in 10 to the 10th

680
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:09,480
you can do that without turning the universe into a black hole.

681
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:13,720
So all of these large-scale adventures are very risky.

682
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:32,800
So are you afraid to make an AI, if you could?

683
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,840
It seems like a self-replicating thing,

684
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:44,320
maybe, just as dangerous as the meanest of AI.

685
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:48,000
Mm-hmm.

686
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,800
Yeah, Michael Crichton had a nice novel.

687
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,920
I forget how we.

688
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,080
What happened?

689
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:01,720
Did anybody read his nanotech novel?

690
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:03,240
Gray, what was it called?

691
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:05,960
Prey PR.

692
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:08,080
Yes, right.

693
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:10,640
What was the solution, or was there one?

694
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:11,320
I don't remember.

695
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:13,400
It's been a while since I read it.

696
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,800
I don't remember.

697
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,160
Not sure I got to the end.

698
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:20,440
Yes.

699
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:24,960
I suspect that AI, if it's able, within five minutes

700
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,480
to make itself that much harder, is

701
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,600
going to outstrip self-replicating machines.

702
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,680
Because self-replicating machines

703
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:34,120
have to constantly requisition researches for themselves.

704
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:37,160
And each of them are only as intelligent,

705
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:39,560
basically, as the cells on the edges,

706
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:45,200
whereas the centralized AI has got a lot of computing power.

707
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:52,560
Yeah, well, if it wants 10 to the 30th bits of memory,

708
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:57,680
it'll probably have to make a self-replicating memory

709
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:58,200
system.

710
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:04,160
But it would surely be smart enough

711
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:07,120
not to make one that will wipe itself out.

712
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,800
Bradley, the solution in Prey was

713
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,320
very similar to war of the worlds.

714
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,320
They defeated it with the virus.

715
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:27,680
Oh.

716
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:28,760
What?

717
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:31,960
Yes, a phage.

718
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,720
Did they make their own, or did it just evolve?

719
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,800
They made their own high school students.

720
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:42,800
Because in the HG Wells one, the virus just

721
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:48,120
happened to be there, and the people didn't make it.

722
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:52,720
But HG Wells must have written that around 1910

723
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:53,800
or something like that.

724
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,520
I feel like the idea that various end-of-world scenarios

725
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:00,720
cancel each other out.

726
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:09,560
Well, the news about that smallpox virus was pretty scary.

727
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,640
I wonder if it's been published.

728
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:24,560
Is the smallpox virus sequence in public property now?

729
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:34,760
Because you could make one in your backyard, Seller.

730
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,320
So you're saying that bad homework by high school

731
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:50,840
students could be a catastrophe?

732
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:51,400
Wait a minute.

733
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:54,240
I think it was the flu virus, wasn't it?

734
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:55,840
Oh, yeah, that's what I heard.

735
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:58,760
Sorry, not smallpox.

736
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:02,520
Smallpox was pretty bad, and we're still

737
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:04,240
getting vaccinated for it, aren't we?

738
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:10,680
I forgot the question.

739
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,960
Never get an idea while you're listening to someone else.

740
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,240
Yes?

741
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:28,240
Sir, one of the problems is aging,

742
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:31,240
and there are people working on that.

743
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:34,240
But I think in parallel, there are people struggling to,

744
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:37,240
like you said, you went into a room

745
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:39,240
and asked people how many of them

746
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:41,240
wanted to live forever and just a handful.

747
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:44,240
Then you went into a room with scientists and a lot more.

748
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:49,240
So that speaks to people working on that.

749
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:54,240
So that speaks to people working on some problems

750
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:58,240
or having an interest or purpose of some sort.

751
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:02,240
Anti-aging worked, and now we have a lot more people

752
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:05,240
living a lot longer, with no control,

753
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:09,240
and no purpose, or at least limited purpose,

754
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:11,240
and just a handful working on it.

755
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:14,240
The question is, how do you get more people interested

756
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:17,240
without having to work on some problems

757
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,240
and without indulging in philosophy

758
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:25,240
of what purpose is, how do we get more people?

759
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:27,240
Interesting.

760
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:30,240
I have a friend who's doing that, Gregory Benford.

761
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:33,240
How many of you know him?

762
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:35,240
He's a first-rate science fiction writer.

763
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,240
And unlike most science fiction writers,

764
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:50,240
he's also a very able physicist and has

765
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:59,240
had a substantial career in low-energy physics.

766
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:04,240
Namely, when he was a young physicist looking

767
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:09,240
for what to do, somebody said they were throwing out

768
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:10,240
their cyclotron.

769
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:19,240
Cyclotron is a cylindrical machine.

770
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:24,240
His is about 12 feet in diameter and weighs quite a few tons.

771
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:30,240
They said, of course, all the young physicists

772
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:33,240
work on high-energy things, and this thing only

773
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:36,240
makes a few million electron volts.

774
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:37,240
Nobody's interested.

775
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:42,240
In such a small exponent.

776
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:48,240
So he got it and set up a laboratory in Irvine University.

777
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:56,240
But anyway, in the last few years,

778
00:51:56,240 --> 00:52:03,240
he started working on selecting drosophila that live long.

779
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:08,240
And he has some that live about somewhere between two

780
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:12,240
and three times as long as regular drosophila.

781
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:18,240
And he knows a lot about what genes are probably involved

782
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:28,240
in that and has a company which I bet you

783
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,240
could invest in if you want.

784
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:35,240
But that's the only one I know of.

785
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:45,240
So the next thing would be to go to mice.

786
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:48,240
And the great thing about, I think the drosophila

787
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:52,240
is five days or something to reproduce,

788
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:56,240
which is some very short time.

789
00:52:56,240 --> 00:53:00,240
So that way, you can do hundreds of years of experiments

790
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:01,240
every term.

791
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:07,240
Was there?

792
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:15,240
So I wonder how many other people are trying to make longer

793
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:19,240
lived fleas and then work their way up the evolutionary.

794
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:25,240
Because nobody knows much about aging.

795
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:31,240
The most well-established thing is the,

796
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:34,240
what do you call the stuff at the end of chromosomes?

797
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:35,240
Telomeres.

798
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:42,240
And every time, at least certain cell families,

799
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:50,240
every time they reproduce, they lose one of those DNA

800
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:53,240
units at the end of the chromosome.

801
00:53:53,240 --> 00:54:03,240
And that stops many cancers from growing because if the cancer

802
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:09,240
cells lose their telomeres, then they

803
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:11,240
can't reproduce for some reason.

804
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:13,240
But of course, some of them find ways

805
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:18,240
to reproduce without that mechanism, whatever it does.

806
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:23,240
So I bet there are a dozen groups working

807
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:25,240
on aging in the world, but you'd think

808
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:28,240
it would be a lot more, whatever the number is.

809
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:37,240
There's a very small number of people working on cryonics,

810
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:40,240
which is, can you freeze an animal

811
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:48,240
and then revive it at some very long time in the future

812
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:55,240
when medical science has progressed to cure the disease

813
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:58,240
that you would have otherwise died of

814
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:00,240
if you hadn't died of being frozen.

815
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:10,240
And in fact, I think I know that Benford has subscribed

816
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,240
to such a service.

817
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:16,240
So the future might have some good science fiction writers.

818
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:24,240
More disasters.

819
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:30,240
What would happen if people did live 200 years

820
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,240
in their present state?

821
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:35,240
Then we would absolutely need robots

822
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:39,240
because we wouldn't be able to hire enough foreigners

823
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:44,240
to take care of them because the foreigners would

824
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:47,240
be getting older too.

825
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:48,240
Yes?

826
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:52,240
Do we need robots if we replace our organs?

827
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:57,240
Oh, if you can reverse aging or prevent aging,

828
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:59,240
then you don't need anything.

829
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:10,240
No, at least we can produce arms that are robotic arms.

830
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:14,240
And it's not the same as reverse engineering.

831
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:16,240
I don't know, a lever or something.

832
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:17,240
Well, it's a nice question.

833
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:20,240
Do it.

834
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:24,240
Do cells wear out like a brain cell?

835
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:27,240
Can a brain cell continue to work for 1,000 years,

836
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:31,240
or will it accumulate other non-genetic changes

837
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:34,240
that nobody really knows?

838
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:39,240
Of course, you can grow bacteria for 1,000 years.

839
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:44,240
But what's happening is they're not just aging.

840
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:46,240
They're evolving.

841
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:52,240
And so lots of them do, in fact, die during this process.

842
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:58,240
And the survivors mutate or develop new genes.

843
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:01,240
I'm sure if you take E. coli and run it

844
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:05,240
in a bunch of test tubes for 1,000 years,

845
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:08,240
it'll end up quite different.

846
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:15,240
So it's not clear that it's immortal.

847
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:18,240
There may be.

848
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:23,240
Every cell has some trace of a few atoms from the original one,

849
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:25,240
but it's not the whole structure.

850
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:26,240
Yeah?

851
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:31,240
If we just get rejuvenating the cells and brain function

852
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:35,240
for 1,000 years, is it robust enough

853
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:39,240
to do the memory management hold on the baggage of 1,000

854
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:42,240
years and handle all that?

855
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:44,240
Do we know?

856
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:47,240
No one has the slightest idea.

857
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:50,240
They're pretty sure that memories

858
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:52,240
are encoded in synapses.

859
00:57:56,240 --> 00:58:02,240
But as far as I know, neuroscience

860
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:06,240
has a sort of vacuum in between the knowledge

861
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:14,240
about individual cells and the larger structures

862
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:18,240
that remember symbolic things, for example.

863
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:22,240
So they know enough about synapses in very simple animals.

864
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:30,240
Well, what was David's conclusion last time?

865
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:37,240
Do we know the encoding of any particular reflex learn

866
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:42,240
thing in that little worm?

867
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:47,240
There's basically only two things that we can,

868
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:50,240
only two encodings that we completely understand

869
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:56,240
from start to finish in any system, as far as I know.

870
00:58:57,240 --> 00:59:01,240
One is the patellar tendon reflex,

871
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:03,240
or the knee-jerk reflex.

872
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:06,240
And the other is the gill retraction

873
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:10,240
reflex in aphasia.

874
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:16,240
What's the MIT professor who mapped out the motor control

875
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:19,240
of the frog legs?

876
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:20,240
Is it Bitsy?

877
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:22,240
What?

878
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:23,240
No.

879
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:25,740
What?

880
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:27,240
No, I think Bitsy.

881
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:28,240
What's his name?

882
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:34,240
The frog has a sort of cerebellum-like

883
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:36,240
two-dimensional structure.

884
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:37,240
And they've mapped.

885
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:51,240
Actually, he's figured out the wiring.

886
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:52,240
No, I'm mistaken.

887
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:57,240
He's figured out the wiring of the motor control of the leg.

888
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:59,240
But it's not learned.

889
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:03,240
So the anatomy is clear enough that you

890
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:08,680
can see how, when it wants to turn left,

891
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:12,240
it moves the two legs in the right way.

892
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:14,800
That's about as far as I think anyone's got.

893
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:19,240
So that's the functional wiring, but not with some learning.

894
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:19,740
Right.

895
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:30,240
But I suspect what will happen is

896
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:33,600
that it won't be so terribly hard

897
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:40,440
to implant artificial gigabytes of memory

898
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:43,680
in parts of the human brain and get people

899
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:46,240
to learn how to operate it.

900
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:49,000
If you can maintain skin cells for 1,000 years,

901
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,040
why not neurons?

902
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:51,120
Right.

903
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:52,720
And we'll be able to do that before we

904
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:54,960
know how the human memory works.

905
01:00:54,960 --> 01:01:01,880
We'll know all about how the nanotechnology RAMs work.

906
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:08,360
And then maybe you can work backwards

907
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:10,800
seeing the kind of mistakes you make

908
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:12,320
when you try to correct it.

909
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:23,520
Well, I want a new disaster.

910
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:30,360
You've got meteors, right?

911
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:31,520
What's that?

912
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:32,880
Meteors.

913
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:38,080
Yes, meteors and volcanoes and those.

914
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:41,000
And there's a nice book by Martin Rees,

915
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:46,760
which is cheerfully called Our Final Hour.

916
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:50,080
Martin Rees is a very good astronomer

917
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:54,080
in England who has the title of astronomer royal.

918
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:07,520
So he's discussing mostly physics type disasters.

919
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:15,200
And I was trying to extend it to how do you make a religion

920
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:22,080
that sucks everybody in, or a logical argument that

921
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:24,880
makes everyone into a terrorist.

922
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:27,680
That's what the terrorists are looking for.

923
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:31,200
And I suppose there's a remote chance

924
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:36,600
that some philosopher will think of something

925
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:38,240
new one of these days.

926
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:44,760
Well, I forget what makes everyone's life savings

927
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:45,360
disappear.

928
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:47,720
Perhaps that's enough.

929
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:49,520
What will they do?

930
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:50,680
Get angry, I suppose.

931
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:58,800
You mustn't tax the rich because then there

932
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:02,680
won't be any job creators.

933
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:05,760
I love the new kind of logic appears every month

934
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:11,720
with the, are there any countries with three parties?

935
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:13,200
Oh, yes.

936
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:16,000
There are countries with three parties.

937
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Who has three parties?

938
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:19,800
England.

939
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:21,840
How does England work?

940
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:23,720
There's labor, social.

941
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:33,040
Are there other countries with just two parties?

942
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:34,600
Seems crazy to have two parties.

943
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:41,520
Yeah, I think two parties is much less common than three

944
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:42,280
or more.

945
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:43,320
Two parties is weird.

946
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:45,120
They're almost always three or more or one.

947
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:48,680
Say it again.

948
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:49,160
Three or one.

949
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:50,840
They're almost always three or more or one.

950
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:52,080
Or one.

951
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:55,160
Australia's pretty close to two parties.

952
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:58,920
It's like two and a third party.

953
01:03:58,920 --> 01:03:59,800
A third party.

954
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:02,120
Yeah.

955
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:07,000
Just a few people who can be moved.

956
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:07,600
That's right.

957
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:08,080
England.

958
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:11,080
My Uncle Harry's famous word, the dog's rights party,

959
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:13,080
in which he and his wife are the only memories.

960
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:19,080
Well, there's this theme that goes around

961
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:21,640
that if you're trying to vote for the third party

962
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:25,320
in the United States, that you're wasting your vote.

963
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:27,200
So that's kind of a destructive idea that

964
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:30,200
keeps it with two parties.

965
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:35,640
Well, they have the same thing in England for a long time.

966
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:37,360
In the last election, they actually

967
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:40,280
were the liberal democrats of France.

968
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:41,760
They became the third party.

969
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:45,560
So nowadays, they're the last three parties.

970
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:48,240
But it took 16 years.

971
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:58,280
Well, I know people who are still mad at Ralph Nader

972
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:04,560
because the Bush thing came with a very small number.

973
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:06,360
The Nader votes could have shifted it.

974
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:12,040
How about something like this for Ralph?

975
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:14,680
Nader sent me a book the other day.

976
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:18,760
Great big book with about a dozen smart people

977
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:20,880
discussing politics.

978
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:21,920
I haven't opened it.

979
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:34,280
Do you have anything on your list

980
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:43,800
that plays on all the genetic stuff, such as, for example,

981
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:48,800
you'll find out that the people who haven't lost their lives

982
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:52,920
have some genetic thing that makes them

983
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:56,440
inferior in the long run, and so they

984
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:59,360
should be eradicated from the population of the Earth

985
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:01,800
in the interests of humankind.

986
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:03,160
People who have a what?

987
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:05,440
Who have blue eyes, for example.

988
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:09,600
And then, of course, they wouldn't be happy with this.

989
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:12,360
And this would create a polarizing effect

990
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:14,400
on the global population as a whole.

991
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:16,400
And they kill off each other.

992
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:26,320
I think this is something that should come up.

993
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:31,120
Well, how did Hitler get this Aryan thing to be so popular?

994
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:37,120
Anybody understand the psychology of Nazism?

995
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:48,200
Because wasn't there something about being blonde?

996
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:51,160
And not very many Germans are actually blonde.

997
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:52,640
So how did he pull this thing off?

998
01:06:56,320 --> 01:07:06,320
Eugenics and race sciences were really popular at the time,

999
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:09,080
not just in Germany.

1000
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:11,720
In particular, a lot of what you see coming out

1001
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:15,800
that proves one thing or another are basically

1002
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:18,520
misunderstanding correlation with causation.

1003
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:19,040
Good point.

1004
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:20,920
A lot of those studies.

1005
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:25,400
I mean, there's also a lot of purposeful government-backed

1006
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:28,560
research and things like that at a specific agenda,

1007
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:30,640
especially with Nukes and Nazi Germany.

1008
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:34,320
But that's just from that side.

1009
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:35,880
You also have lots of other things,

1010
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:37,680
like the position Germany was in,

1011
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:46,880
and people wanting to scapegoat, and social and cultural ideas.

1012
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:49,400
Not really just the eugenics that were being

1013
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:52,440
looked into at that point.

1014
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:55,760
So that was just one feature at some particular period

1015
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:59,640
of the evolution of the thing.

1016
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:01,640
Maybe it was at the beginning, when

1017
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:03,520
if you could just get all the blonde people,

1018
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:05,000
that would give you a start.

1019
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,680
And then you could broaden it out.

1020
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:09,520
No, they really look back to the Huns,

1021
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:12,800
which are supposedly of Nordic descent.

1022
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:15,840
The German culture is pretty thick with the Nordic mythology

1023
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:17,480
as well.

1024
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:19,760
They feel like there's a connection even if they're not

1025
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:20,240
all blonde.

1026
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:25,160
Just think, we could back-breed them.

1027
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:33,160
With enough correlation, we could make a Hun.

1028
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:36,560
It'd be a great project.

1029
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:40,320
So people tend to divide themselves into groups

1030
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:43,800
and hate the other.

1031
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:46,360
The sports industry is based on that.

1032
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:47,520
Which industry?

1033
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:49,480
Sports industry.

1034
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:52,160
So they're like a team of people that you

1035
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:54,360
don't even know and you don't care.

1036
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:57,160
And you cheer for them to beat the other team.

1037
01:08:57,160 --> 01:09:00,360
And that's kind of irrational.

1038
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:04,520
There are some studies, I think it's called Stanford study,

1039
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:08,160
that they put some students into a prison.

1040
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:12,560
And some of them act as the police officers

1041
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:14,320
and some as prisoners.

1042
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:17,840
And then they tend to divide each other.

1043
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:21,360
And so the prisoners start hating the police.

1044
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:26,120
And the police start acting more violently.

1045
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:33,280
And so if you merchandise, like if you say to people,

1046
01:09:33,280 --> 01:09:36,960
we are as a group better, people tend to believe that

1047
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:38,800
and tend to hate another group.

1048
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:43,640
And it's independent of how the groups formed.

1049
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:46,840
So it's just how we are.

1050
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:49,440
We tend to divide into groups.

1051
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:54,720
Could we invent a sport to see if football players are better

1052
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:56,680
or worse than basketball players?

1053
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:04,000
I would love to invent something that undermines

1054
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:08,920
this whole sports thing by getting a real serious argument

1055
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:11,120
about which sport is better.

1056
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:13,400
But you might just create an uber sport.

1057
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:14,960
It might go terribly wrong.

1058
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:18,400
Yeah, I suspected that would backfire.

1059
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:20,000
What was the key word?

1060
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,160
Like an uber sport.

1061
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:21,840
Uber?

1062
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:25,560
Yeah, like the sport that conquer all sports.

1063
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:26,640
Yeah.

1064
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:28,440
Did you have that on the list yet?

1065
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:29,600
No.

1066
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:30,920
An uber profession.

1067
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:35,200
And then just on the world sports.

1068
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:42,680
Well, just imagine working in an employment agency.

1069
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:47,920
There you're not doing, maybe you're inventing jobs.

1070
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:52,120
And you don't realize that you have an uber job of some sort.

1071
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:59,040
It's the Republican argument that you shouldn't tax people

1072
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:01,680
because they're the job creators.

1073
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:04,160
It's just such a strange argument

1074
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:17,440
because when Patrick and I were running the AI lab,

1075
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:26,200
we had a great guy in charge of engineering.

1076
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:30,160
And we were arguing about jobs.

1077
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:32,600
And he said, if you want jobs, why don't you

1078
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:36,080
just get a very long rope and put a million people

1079
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:47,320
at each end and see who can pull the other

1080
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:49,720
across the Mississippi?

1081
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:53,520
And because football players would win.

1082
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:55,000
Yeah, that's here.

1083
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:58,040
Oh, the basketball player's called Joe.

1084
01:11:58,040 --> 01:12:01,000
And I was just turned on the radio this morning.

1085
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:05,560
And this casino is going to create 3,000 jobs, it said.

1086
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:09,520
And isn't that just like the rope?

1087
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:15,760
That is, these people are not actually doing anything

1088
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:19,560
except taking money from the poor.

1089
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:22,920
Is it Wall Street doing that to smart people?

1090
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:23,520
Well, yes.

1091
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:28,720
And the tragedy is that I've been through this 100 times.

1092
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:33,720
But when I was a young professor,

1093
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:37,880
all the students became professors.

1094
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:44,680
And there seemed to be a point to it all.

1095
01:12:44,680 --> 01:12:49,720
But around 1980, things started flattening out.

1096
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:54,240
And American universities stopped expanding.

1097
01:12:54,240 --> 01:13:01,400
And I think it's partly that the lifespan has extended one year

1098
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:03,560
every four.

1099
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:10,600
So you don't need new professors very often.

1100
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:13,380
And the universities haven't grown.

1101
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:17,340
So almost all my first students are professors.

1102
01:13:17,340 --> 01:13:20,380
And almost all the recent ones aren't.

1103
01:13:20,380 --> 01:13:24,020
And a lot of them are in Wall Street.

1104
01:13:24,020 --> 01:13:24,980
So what can we do?

1105
01:13:27,620 --> 01:13:31,100
Regulate Wall Street properly.

1106
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:34,940
Maybe you should tax people if their IQ is high

1107
01:13:34,940 --> 01:13:36,140
and they make more money.

1108
01:13:36,140 --> 01:13:36,640
No.

1109
01:13:40,380 --> 01:13:43,660
A mathematician could work that out and make it right.

1110
01:13:43,660 --> 01:13:45,780
Some people were working at getting the highest IQ

1111
01:13:45,780 --> 01:13:48,500
they could, but not too high that they'd be passed.

1112
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:49,820
Not too high, yes.

1113
01:13:49,820 --> 01:13:53,620
Or just taking a test and show that IQ.

1114
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:00,020
It doesn't.

1115
01:14:00,020 --> 01:14:04,460
I mean, a lot of that boils down to pretty simple economics.

1116
01:14:04,460 --> 01:14:06,500
Or people can make a lot of money in Wall Street.

1117
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:10,180
And the system is set up such that that's fairly

1118
01:14:10,180 --> 01:14:11,900
doable for a large number of people.

1119
01:14:11,900 --> 01:14:14,460
And it's really, really hard to get jobs as professors.

1120
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:22,860
But if there was more money in research,

1121
01:14:22,860 --> 01:14:25,700
I imagine you would see a lot more people doing research.

1122
01:14:25,700 --> 01:14:29,260
If they made enough money, then that's the right reason to.

1123
01:14:29,260 --> 01:14:33,180
If you make enough money, can you buy a professorship?

1124
01:14:33,180 --> 01:14:33,860
Yes.

1125
01:14:33,860 --> 01:14:36,180
Maybe you can start your own lab.

1126
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:39,420
Yeah, that's true.

1127
01:14:39,420 --> 01:14:41,340
But then you're inclined not to publish

1128
01:14:41,340 --> 01:14:44,340
if you actually do anything good.

1129
01:14:44,340 --> 01:14:45,540
And you keep it a secret.

1130
01:14:51,420 --> 01:14:53,340
Well, how many of you want to be a professor?

1131
01:14:59,420 --> 01:14:59,940
It's fun.

1132
01:14:59,940 --> 01:15:01,500
You don't have to do anything.

1133
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:06,820
It gives all the more reason to do things.

1134
01:15:10,940 --> 01:15:14,700
I also heard that in the past, you

1135
01:15:14,700 --> 01:15:18,140
had to deal with, I guess, maybe less of the admin

1136
01:15:18,140 --> 01:15:19,740
and political sort of management you

1137
01:15:19,740 --> 01:15:21,940
have to do nowadays as a professor.

1138
01:15:21,940 --> 01:15:24,580
So if somebody simply wanted to, or mainly

1139
01:15:24,580 --> 01:15:27,020
wanted to be a professor to teach students or to help

1140
01:15:27,020 --> 01:15:29,540
people, then it might have been a better idea

1141
01:15:29,540 --> 01:15:32,460
with those assumptions back then.

1142
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:34,060
I missed the first point.

1143
01:15:34,060 --> 01:15:38,940
That maybe now being a professor isn't as straightforward

1144
01:15:38,940 --> 01:15:43,340
as teaching and helping students and sort of the more

1145
01:15:43,340 --> 01:15:45,860
normal goals of why somebody might want to be a professor.

1146
01:15:45,860 --> 01:15:50,340
Nowadays, it's also a lot more dealing with politics

1147
01:15:50,340 --> 01:15:53,660
and dealing with the struggle to get tenure and to look good

1148
01:15:53,660 --> 01:15:57,140
and these things that maybe are sort of secondary for people

1149
01:15:57,140 --> 01:16:01,580
and get in the way that they actually want to do.

1150
01:16:01,580 --> 01:16:03,620
Oh, yeah.

1151
01:16:03,620 --> 01:16:08,180
That might be true, because in the golden age,

1152
01:16:08,180 --> 01:16:12,220
things were expanding, just that.

1153
01:16:12,220 --> 01:16:15,140
So if you did want to just, if your main goal was

1154
01:16:15,140 --> 01:16:18,540
to teach people, then it might, nowadays,

1155
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:21,060
maybe the best way to do that wouldn't necessarily

1156
01:16:21,060 --> 01:16:22,820
be to be a professor.

1157
01:16:22,820 --> 01:16:25,940
You would get a job where you could get paid pretty well

1158
01:16:25,940 --> 01:16:27,820
to do something where you weren't a professor.

1159
01:16:27,820 --> 01:16:30,220
And then your spare time, you could teach a lot of people.

1160
01:16:30,220 --> 01:16:31,940
And you could teach people that maybe

1161
01:16:31,940 --> 01:16:35,940
needed to be taught rather than the ones that you paid to teach.

1162
01:16:35,940 --> 01:16:37,620
Well, it's going to be interesting to see

1163
01:16:37,620 --> 01:16:41,500
what happens if, what's the professor who

1164
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:47,140
has the huge web thing going?

1165
01:16:48,140 --> 01:16:50,020
What?

1166
01:16:50,020 --> 01:16:53,100
What?

1167
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:56,300
Is this guy, this California professor

1168
01:16:56,300 --> 01:16:59,700
who has got millions of people watching?

1169
01:16:59,700 --> 01:17:02,420
Sebastian Thrun?

1170
01:17:02,420 --> 01:17:03,700
Sebastian Thrun?

1171
01:17:03,700 --> 01:17:05,580
And Peter Norberg.

1172
01:17:05,580 --> 01:17:07,620
Oh, that, but that's very small compared

1173
01:17:07,620 --> 01:17:11,060
to the new one, which the guy named Khan.

1174
01:17:14,060 --> 01:17:15,860
Actually, how big is the Google thing?

1175
01:17:18,140 --> 01:17:19,340
The Thrun thing.

1176
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:20,820
It's the Stanford.

1177
01:17:20,820 --> 01:17:23,220
Is that pretty big now?

1178
01:17:23,220 --> 01:17:24,460
It's several times bigger.

1179
01:17:24,460 --> 01:17:26,620
And they're going to expand.

1180
01:17:26,620 --> 01:17:30,620
So that, well, what does that mean?

1181
01:17:34,140 --> 01:17:37,620
Can they actually get better results

1182
01:17:37,620 --> 01:17:39,740
than classroom teaching?

1183
01:17:39,740 --> 01:17:42,180
I don't see why not.

1184
01:17:42,180 --> 01:17:46,940
He's getting better results in some districts.

1185
01:17:47,740 --> 01:17:48,740
Ken?

1186
01:17:48,740 --> 01:17:51,740
Oh, oh, that student.

1187
01:17:51,740 --> 01:17:54,660
Yeah, Khan Academy actually was another teacher professor.

1188
01:17:54,660 --> 01:17:56,980
He began in finance and started out

1189
01:17:56,980 --> 01:18:00,980
with one video tutorial for his niece that he was tutoring.

1190
01:18:00,980 --> 01:18:02,700
I just put it up on YouTube for anybody

1191
01:18:02,700 --> 01:18:06,100
who got positive reviews and started cycling.

1192
01:18:06,100 --> 01:18:07,580
Thank you.

1193
01:18:07,580 --> 01:18:10,060
Well, there's a lot of interesting questions

1194
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:31,940
about whether it seems to me, in my experience,

1195
01:18:31,980 --> 01:18:43,220
was interesting because if a professor said something

1196
01:18:43,220 --> 01:18:48,140
that surprised me, I would ask him how he thought, or her.

1197
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:52,460
There weren't many hers, I have to admit.

1198
01:18:52,460 --> 01:18:57,460
I would ask the professor, how did he think of that?

1199
01:18:57,460 --> 01:19:00,980
And so because I knew that I could look it up

1200
01:19:00,980 --> 01:19:07,220
if it was something, some proof of a theorem,

1201
01:19:07,220 --> 01:19:08,500
then it's probably published.

1202
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:13,180
And very likely, Gauss's proof is better than the current one

1203
01:19:13,180 --> 01:19:15,980
anyway.

1204
01:19:15,980 --> 01:19:18,180
That's a joke, I think.

1205
01:19:18,180 --> 01:19:28,300
But I don't see how you could get that out

1206
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:32,540
of a non-interactive system.

1207
01:19:32,540 --> 01:19:36,220
You can't go and ask Andrew Gleason,

1208
01:19:36,220 --> 01:19:38,540
how did you get that idea?

1209
01:19:38,540 --> 01:19:44,940
Then he would struggle and maybe tell me

1210
01:19:44,940 --> 01:19:46,660
how he got that idea, which was.

1211
01:19:49,460 --> 01:19:55,900
But perhaps a great teacher can evolve lectures in which you

1212
01:19:55,900 --> 01:20:01,340
not only explain what the student has to know on a test,

1213
01:20:01,340 --> 01:20:06,420
but you can teach ways to think about it.

1214
01:20:06,420 --> 01:20:07,140
I don't know how.

1215
01:20:15,140 --> 01:20:15,660
Exactly.

1216
01:20:15,660 --> 01:20:18,140
That's the question.

1217
01:20:18,140 --> 01:20:21,180
And maybe you can do a tremendous amount of it

1218
01:20:21,180 --> 01:20:26,740
as the thing evolves, because right now, there's

1219
01:20:26,740 --> 01:20:28,420
nothing the student can type when

1220
01:20:28,420 --> 01:20:29,980
they're watching the lecture.

1221
01:20:29,980 --> 01:20:32,540
I presume nobody's.

1222
01:20:32,540 --> 01:20:37,340
Or is there an army of graduate students

1223
01:20:37,340 --> 01:20:42,780
at terminals answering questions to go with these lectures?

1224
01:20:42,780 --> 01:20:43,300
What?

1225
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:44,580
These online courses.

1226
01:20:44,580 --> 01:20:45,500
Yeah.

1227
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:48,260
Well, what they're learning from the New York Times

1228
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:52,660
is writing up both Kahn and Stanford as models.

1229
01:20:52,660 --> 01:20:59,900
And Stanford took from Kahn that you have 10 minute, no more

1230
01:20:59,900 --> 01:21:05,300
than five or 10 minute presentations,

1231
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:07,140
and then you have some activity.

1232
01:21:07,140 --> 01:21:09,580
Yeah, where did that hour come from?

1233
01:21:09,580 --> 01:21:10,080
Yeah.

1234
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:17,080
So in that, but after the 10 minutes,

1235
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:19,840
is there an army of people you can interact with?

1236
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:23,520
Well, you interact with the problem,

1237
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:27,320
and then you get another 10 minute thing.

1238
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:34,000
Now, some places are organizing so they have,

1239
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:38,760
like they expect parents, a parent, for example,

1240
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:42,720
to be with a high school student or elementary school

1241
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:47,040
student while they're interacting

1242
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:51,560
with this computer stuff.

1243
01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:53,640
Yes.

1244
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:57,200
At least in the Kahn videos, people

1245
01:21:57,200 --> 01:21:59,440
can ask questions underneath each video.

1246
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:01,240
And if you look under a video, sometimes you

1247
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:04,720
can see a fair amount of decent questions.

1248
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:07,280
So in this case, you might not only have a question answered,

1249
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:10,560
you might get other questions that you need to ask.

1250
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:13,480
And it's always there to look for reference.

1251
01:22:13,480 --> 01:22:17,080
Well, in fact, interacting with a person

1252
01:22:17,080 --> 01:22:20,160
could be that the person, if you didn't

1253
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:22,640
seem to understand something, the person

1254
01:22:22,640 --> 01:22:26,000
gives you similar problems that are just slightly

1255
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,280
different point of view or slightly easier

1256
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:35,640
or analogies with something that they know you know.

1257
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:39,200
So presuming in the long run, you

1258
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:43,840
can make these interactive systems have large bodies

1259
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:50,280
of pedagogical knowledge for each kind of problem,

1260
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:52,880
you could have a huge tree of what are the most

1261
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:55,240
common misunderstandings and what's

1262
01:22:55,240 --> 01:23:01,560
the best hint for getting out of this dead end or that dead end.

1263
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:04,040
So maybe something will evolve.

1264
01:23:04,040 --> 01:23:08,280
But it means there either have to be assistants who

1265
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:12,600
can do it, which is unlikely, or natural language

1266
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:16,280
understanders that can.

1267
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:18,800
So you can reply to this or ask it questions.

1268
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:21,560
And you can go find a better lecture

1269
01:23:21,560 --> 01:23:24,640
for if you're having that particular trouble.

1270
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:26,920
Yes?

1271
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:31,120
Well, don't you think traditional classroom,

1272
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:35,520
they're lacking things like that as well?

1273
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:40,840
I don't think the traditional classroom has done too well.

1274
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:45,440
Well, normally, if you have 30 students in a classroom,

1275
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:50,560
the teacher is paying attention to four or five of them

1276
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:53,680
because most people don't interact.

1277
01:23:53,680 --> 01:23:57,160
And every class, if you're lucky,

1278
01:23:57,160 --> 01:23:58,760
you have several students who interact.

1279
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:11,800
I kind of feel like with, I feel like since there's so much

1280
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:14,880
that already works just by making these lectures

1281
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:20,360
like a social tool with all the YouTube videos,

1282
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:22,720
it's basically like a frequently asked question

1283
01:24:22,720 --> 01:24:25,280
list in the comments.

1284
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:35,240
So I feel like since there's already an easier than AI

1285
01:24:35,240 --> 01:24:38,720
solution to help with that, there's never

1286
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:44,560
going to be an impetus to actually go and build

1287
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:50,400
a system that will definitely answer your questions

1288
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:53,880
about the lecture correctly or give you more practice points.

1289
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:57,920
It'd be such a harder infrastructure to set up.

1290
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:00,680
And I think before that happens, there's

1291
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:05,520
just going to be more tools to make anything easily

1292
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:06,800
socially shareable.

1293
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:12,920
I think people are going to gravitate more

1294
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:18,400
towards making things easier in a social way.

1295
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:22,360
That already seems to be.

1296
01:25:22,360 --> 01:25:24,320
Well, that's raising an AI question

1297
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:29,320
because you can imagine some years out

1298
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:38,240
that this system evolves and the Stanford thing gets

1299
01:25:38,240 --> 01:25:41,640
to the point where you can ask a question

1300
01:25:41,640 --> 01:25:49,320
and like Siri or this dragon thing here,

1301
01:25:49,320 --> 01:25:51,480
you ask it a question, it understands it,

1302
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:56,520
and it roots itself to another example of the same thing.

1303
01:25:56,520 --> 01:25:59,840
And gradually, a huge database appears

1304
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:05,720
that teaches you a lot of abstract algebra

1305
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:09,720
and has thousands of examples and pulls out just

1306
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:15,360
the right one for the confusion it diagnoses you to have.

1307
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:19,080
So I think, in other words, maybe the AIs

1308
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:24,040
will emerge from making interactive teaching programs

1309
01:26:24,040 --> 01:26:28,360
rather than these sort of artificial projects

1310
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:31,760
where you're trying to make a program that actually

1311
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:34,960
solves some hard problem.

1312
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:37,920
But making a program that has thousands of ways

1313
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:43,760
to solve a problem and it didn't invent them

1314
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:46,160
might be even better.

1315
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:49,440
So I think one issue here, OK, there are two issues at hand.

1316
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:50,360
One issue is that.

1317
01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:55,520
After all, your calculus teacher didn't invent calculus.

1318
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:58,160
That was Newton.

1319
01:26:58,160 --> 01:27:00,000
So in speaking about Khan Academy,

1320
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,760
I think it's important to separate

1321
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:03,320
a couple of different issues.

1322
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:07,000
So the first issue is whether Khan Academy is a good tool.

1323
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:08,680
And I think, in this case, it's clear

1324
01:27:08,680 --> 01:27:14,480
that it solves the problems that it does.

1325
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:15,360
How do I say this?

1326
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:16,840
It's good at what it claims to do.

1327
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:21,040
So some advantages that it has is that it

1328
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:23,080
explains the concepts clearly.

1329
01:27:23,080 --> 01:27:27,720
And the video format allows you to go back and sort of listen

1330
01:27:27,720 --> 01:27:29,400
to things again if you don't understand them

1331
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:33,040
the first time, which you don't quite get in a lecture hall.

1332
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:35,080
And the third advantage, as Lily pointed out,

1333
01:27:35,480 --> 01:27:39,520
it sort of acts as a social hub where different people can

1334
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:42,320
look at each other's questions.

1335
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:44,680
Now, just because Khan Academy is good at the things

1336
01:27:44,680 --> 01:27:47,120
that it claims to do and maybe some other things, too,

1337
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:53,280
doesn't mean that there aren't other tools that

1338
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:56,520
can do more than what Khan Academy does

1339
01:27:56,520 --> 01:27:58,680
and can sort of expand the way that we

1340
01:27:58,680 --> 01:28:00,760
interact with these learning tools.

1341
01:28:00,760 --> 01:28:04,880
So I think it's sort of fruitless to say,

1342
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:07,360
oh, well, Khan Academy is already really good at teaching.

1343
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:08,560
That's all we need.

1344
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:11,680
Because I think, as you said, there

1345
01:28:11,680 --> 01:28:13,760
are other tools that are completely

1346
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:17,080
way bigger than the scope of what Khan Academy does that

1347
01:28:17,080 --> 01:28:19,560
can be really good for education.

1348
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:22,960
So for instance, some things that this thing does not

1349
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:25,560
address are like, OK, so how does

1350
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:30,080
the issue of interaction between the professor

1351
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:32,440
and the students come into play with learning?

1352
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:36,720
Or what if you can ask questions that you haven't covered

1353
01:28:36,720 --> 01:28:39,560
and it'll give you a response?

1354
01:28:39,560 --> 01:28:43,280
So I guess it's the idea of, OK, so this tool

1355
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:45,160
is good for these sets of things.

1356
01:28:45,160 --> 01:28:48,360
But then there are other features

1357
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:50,040
that we might want in a learning tool

1358
01:28:50,040 --> 01:28:52,560
that it currently doesn't have and it doesn't even

1359
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:53,320
try to have.

1360
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:58,320
So another thing is that a lot of times,

1361
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:00,320
we'll ask questions to the students.

1362
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:01,320
I mean, I don't know.

1363
01:29:01,320 --> 01:29:04,320
I've seen learning systems where I think the Stanford one does

1364
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:07,320
this is based on how you manage the questions that will then

1365
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:10,320
hear new questions toward whoever the week is.

1366
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:13,320
But if you think about a system that might have 40,000 students

1367
01:29:13,320 --> 01:29:16,320
and you can learn which questions help lead students

1368
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:19,320
in certain areas converge towards becoming stronger

1369
01:29:19,320 --> 01:29:21,320
fastest, then it's like a teacher who's

1370
01:29:21,320 --> 01:29:24,320
taught 40,000 students.

1371
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:27,320
But which takes very few teachers

1372
01:29:27,320 --> 01:29:29,320
that have that sort of experience

1373
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:32,320
or corrective knowledge in some sense.

1374
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:34,320
There are some common skills you can

1375
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:36,320
get only in a computer system that

1376
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:39,320
are hard to replicate in the real world.

1377
01:29:39,320 --> 01:29:40,320
MARVIN MINSKY.

1378
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:44,320
The system has to get to some level of understanding

1379
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:47,320
that we're nowhere near yet.

1380
01:29:47,320 --> 01:29:50,320
But with things like Siri, apparently,

1381
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:57,320
you can bluff your way through very well and maybe well enough

1382
01:29:57,320 --> 01:30:02,320
that then you can find four or five answers

1383
01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:04,320
to the student's question.

1384
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:10,320
And the student can quickly see that this particular one is

1385
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:13,320
the student has to be encouraged to be

1386
01:30:13,320 --> 01:30:15,320
skeptical of the machine.

1387
01:30:15,320 --> 01:30:18,320
So you ask it a question, and it gives you

1388
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:19,320
these different answers.

1389
01:30:19,320 --> 01:30:21,320
And you say, well, it didn't understand me

1390
01:30:21,320 --> 01:30:22,320
for this and that.

1391
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:24,320
OK.

1392
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:29,320
Instead of getting upset and trying

1393
01:30:29,320 --> 01:30:32,320
to convince yourself that it understood you,

1394
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:35,320
just say, oh, it's just a dumb machine.

1395
01:30:35,320 --> 01:30:40,320
But I bet one of these five replies is what I really need.

1396
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:41,320
Yeah?

1397
01:30:41,320 --> 01:30:45,320
I don't know if you ever heard about Quora.

1398
01:30:45,320 --> 01:30:46,320
Spell it.

1399
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:52,320
K-U-O-R-A.

1400
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:53,320
No, I don't.

1401
01:30:53,320 --> 01:30:54,320
Haven't heard of it.

1402
01:30:54,320 --> 01:31:01,320
So basically, it's a website where you ask random questions,

1403
01:31:01,320 --> 01:31:02,320
not random.

1404
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:05,320
But they are very specialized questions.

1405
01:31:05,320 --> 01:31:06,320
And it's divided.

1406
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:07,320
I don't know.

1407
01:31:07,320 --> 01:31:09,320
Maybe there's AI, neuroscience.

1408
01:31:09,320 --> 01:31:13,320
And it's very good, because there are a lot of smart people

1409
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:15,320
there, like the community there.

1410
01:31:15,320 --> 01:31:18,320
Oh, it's a social network?

1411
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:20,320
Yeah, kind of a social network.

1412
01:31:20,320 --> 01:31:22,320
And I don't know.

1413
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:24,320
For example, for this class, there are some questions

1414
01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:26,320
that I have in my mind.

1415
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:30,320
And sometimes, I can just post, and really smart people

1416
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:31,320
will answer.

1417
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:34,320
There are a lot of alumni from MIT,

1418
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:37,320
and a lot of people from San Francisco,

1419
01:31:37,320 --> 01:31:39,320
from the Bay Area.

1420
01:31:39,320 --> 01:31:43,320
And also, there's another resource.

1421
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:47,320
I don't know if you ever heard about it, Edge,

1422
01:31:47,320 --> 01:31:51,320
where thinkers, they can post what they are thinking,

1423
01:31:51,320 --> 01:31:56,320
like smart people, as groups.

1424
01:31:56,320 --> 01:31:59,320
Your friend, Brockman.

1425
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:00,320
Yes.

1426
01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:01,320
Right?

1427
01:32:01,320 --> 01:32:02,320
His Edge.

1428
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:04,320
Yeah.

1429
01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:07,320
He has quite a good collection of smart people.

1430
01:32:13,320 --> 01:32:18,320
And these may be good for questions that

1431
01:32:18,320 --> 01:32:25,320
are more research-oriented, or that Siri can't solve right now.

1432
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:26,820
Mm-hmm.

1433
01:32:33,400 --> 01:32:35,040
I've been using this Dragon thing,

1434
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:41,000
because Siri's won't run on my iPhone 4.

1435
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:46,040
But Dragon has a question-answering thing,

1436
01:32:46,040 --> 01:32:49,320
and it's unbelievably good.

1437
01:32:49,320 --> 01:32:51,320
It's the same company.

1438
01:32:51,320 --> 01:32:52,320
What?

1439
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:54,320
It's the same company.

1440
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:57,320
Nuance is running the Siri thing?

1441
01:33:00,320 --> 01:33:01,320
Oh.

1442
01:33:01,320 --> 01:33:02,320
Oh, OK.

1443
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:07,320
So maybe it's the same speech engine they stole from Dragon.

1444
01:33:15,320 --> 01:33:17,320
It's remarkably good, or else I've

1445
01:33:17,320 --> 01:33:20,320
got the hang of asking the right question.

1446
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:34,320
Well, how about one more disaster?

1447
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:47,320
What about wireheading?

1448
01:33:47,320 --> 01:33:48,320
Oh.

1449
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:51,320
If it becomes cheap and convenient for everyone

1450
01:33:51,320 --> 01:33:53,320
to have their own personal paradise,

1451
01:33:53,320 --> 01:33:55,320
they'll quickly fix the devices and stuff.

1452
01:33:55,320 --> 01:33:56,320
Personal what?

1453
01:33:56,320 --> 01:33:57,320
Paradise.

1454
01:33:57,320 --> 01:33:58,320
Yeah.

1455
01:33:58,320 --> 01:34:03,320
Well, it's just turning this pleasure center on without any

1456
01:34:03,320 --> 01:34:05,320
That's wireheading.

1457
01:34:05,320 --> 01:34:07,320
The opposite of the singularity.

1458
01:34:07,320 --> 01:34:10,320
Everyone's just on their own, completely disconnected,

1459
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:11,320
and everybody's happy.

1460
01:34:11,320 --> 01:34:11,820
Yeah.

1461
01:34:20,040 --> 01:34:26,280
Well, there are some people who get addicted

1462
01:34:26,280 --> 01:34:35,680
to narcotics in one dose, and lots of people in five or 10.

1463
01:34:35,680 --> 01:34:41,440
But you could imagine a narcotic that

1464
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:45,000
addicts you in one dose reliably.

1465
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:55,880
That could be pretty dangerous, but you

1466
01:34:55,880 --> 01:34:57,040
have to learn to hate pleasure.

1467
01:34:57,040 --> 01:34:57,540
Yes.

1468
01:35:03,960 --> 01:35:06,080
How do you get people to like hard problems?

1469
01:35:09,480 --> 01:35:12,320
All of you wouldn't be here if you didn't really

1470
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:15,720
actually like hard problems.

1471
01:35:15,720 --> 01:35:16,840
Lots of people don't.

1472
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:22,280
If you learn to hate pleasure, wouldn't you

1473
01:35:22,280 --> 01:35:26,920
learn to hate the pleasure you get from solving hard problems?

1474
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,440
If you use the same word for both.

1475
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:39,680
But maybe I had a complaint about that in the Emotion

1476
01:35:39,680 --> 01:35:46,760
Machine book, which is that we don't

1477
01:35:46,760 --> 01:35:52,040
have a lot of words in common use for ways to think.

1478
01:35:52,040 --> 01:35:58,440
And there are a lot of emotion words,

1479
01:35:58,440 --> 01:36:01,120
but I don't know how many synonyms for pleasure

1480
01:36:01,120 --> 01:36:06,400
are there for different kinds.

1481
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:07,520
I can't think of many.

1482
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:15,660
Joy, happiness, do those count, or are those two part of it?

1483
01:36:15,660 --> 01:36:16,160
Yeah.

1484
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:20,760
Right.

1485
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:22,080
Maybe on the other end.

1486
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:25,200
Passion, no.

1487
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:28,240
Does relief count?

1488
01:36:28,240 --> 01:36:33,880
That's a very good point, because a lot of pleasures

1489
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:37,320
are when something stops hurting.

1490
01:36:37,320 --> 01:36:41,640
Anyway, I think, yes, there's a big problem of language

1491
01:36:41,640 --> 01:36:44,840
for thinking about thinking.

1492
01:36:44,840 --> 01:36:53,440
And I always think about why Galileo

1493
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:58,160
didn't discover the things that Newton did.

1494
01:36:58,160 --> 01:37:04,400
And I never asked a scholar, but from reading Galileo,

1495
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:06,560
I have the impression that he knew

1496
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:09,520
that there was energy and momentum,

1497
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:12,080
and he thought that they were, and he

1498
01:37:12,080 --> 01:37:15,200
didn't distinguish them.

1499
01:37:15,200 --> 01:37:20,040
So there's vis viva, which is the life of motion,

1500
01:37:20,040 --> 01:37:21,920
or I don't know what it means.

1501
01:37:26,360 --> 01:37:31,080
But Newton knows that mv squared and mv are very different.

1502
01:37:31,080 --> 01:37:39,880
And I don't think Galileo got that, and so he got stuck,

1503
01:37:39,880 --> 01:37:42,320
because they're both conserved under slightly

1504
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:43,240
different conditions.

1505
01:37:43,240 --> 01:37:44,520
Isn't that terrible?

1506
01:37:44,520 --> 01:37:46,280
How many of you found that hard?

1507
01:37:49,960 --> 01:37:52,400
Do you remember when you learned about momentum?

1508
01:37:56,440 --> 01:37:56,940
I don't.

1509
01:38:00,640 --> 01:38:04,560
Do you mean when we write about it in a tacit knowledge sense?

1510
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:08,020
No, the word.

1511
01:38:08,020 --> 01:38:12,340
Is it from some grade school course, or is it college?

1512
01:38:12,340 --> 01:38:13,740
Early grade school.

1513
01:38:13,740 --> 01:38:16,540
Must be grade school, because I can't remember learning it,

1514
01:38:16,540 --> 01:38:18,860
so I don't know.

1515
01:38:25,980 --> 01:38:28,600
I have a grandson who just discovered something

1516
01:38:28,600 --> 01:38:34,620
for the derivative of acceleration.

1517
01:38:34,620 --> 01:38:38,820
It's called jerk in some textbooks,

1518
01:38:38,820 --> 01:38:40,660
but he has a two-dimensional version,

1519
01:38:40,660 --> 01:38:43,780
and it took him a while to explain it to me.

1520
01:38:50,380 --> 01:38:52,340
I mean, it took me a while to understand it.

1521
01:38:57,740 --> 01:39:02,140
So I think our emotion words are not very good anyway.

1522
01:39:05,620 --> 01:39:08,580
If a word is old, it's probably not.

1523
01:39:14,540 --> 01:39:15,260
Yeah?

1524
01:39:15,260 --> 01:39:21,380
So you asked how can we increase the amount of people

1525
01:39:21,380 --> 01:39:23,620
that solve the hardest problems.

1526
01:39:23,620 --> 01:39:28,380
We need role models that solve hard problems.

1527
01:39:28,380 --> 01:39:34,020
So for example, professors that are role models for these people

1528
01:39:34,420 --> 01:39:36,740
kind of advertise that for people.

1529
01:39:36,740 --> 01:39:42,020
So an example of that, like in my high school,

1530
01:39:42,020 --> 01:39:45,420
my high school is very science-oriented in Brazil.

1531
01:39:45,420 --> 01:39:50,060
And most of the people that come here to MIT from Brazil

1532
01:39:50,060 --> 01:39:53,940
are from my high school, and it's kind of small.

1533
01:39:53,940 --> 01:39:59,060
There are, I think, two people that come from Brazil

1534
01:39:59,060 --> 01:40:01,740
of this high school.

1535
01:40:01,740 --> 01:40:03,580
Etapa.

1536
01:40:03,580 --> 01:40:04,780
Where?

1537
01:40:04,780 --> 01:40:05,860
In Sao Paulo.

1538
01:40:05,860 --> 01:40:06,980
Oh, OK.

1539
01:40:06,980 --> 01:40:08,620
Yeah.

1540
01:40:08,620 --> 01:40:11,580
There are students that work with Winston, for example.

1541
01:40:11,580 --> 01:40:14,980
There is PhD students now in Harvard

1542
01:40:14,980 --> 01:40:17,220
that are from this high school.

1543
01:40:17,220 --> 01:40:20,980
And the professors, they motivate the students

1544
01:40:20,980 --> 01:40:27,180
by telling stories about other old people that

1545
01:40:27,180 --> 01:40:29,260
went through the same kind of thing

1546
01:40:29,260 --> 01:40:30,940
that they were going through.

1547
01:40:31,660 --> 01:40:32,540
Funny stories.

1548
01:40:32,540 --> 01:40:37,740
And they motivate by telling the story,

1549
01:40:37,740 --> 01:40:40,340
the successful stories.

1550
01:40:40,340 --> 01:40:44,940
And by saying, oh, you could go to MIT, which is a great place.

1551
01:40:44,940 --> 01:40:48,620
And there's these funny stories about these people

1552
01:40:48,620 --> 01:40:51,900
that they become kind of stars.

1553
01:40:51,900 --> 01:40:56,020
So can you duplicate that high school, or is it unique?

1554
01:40:56,020 --> 01:40:59,260
I think it can be duplicated.

1555
01:40:59,260 --> 01:41:03,980
You just need some smart person, or some few smart people

1556
01:41:03,980 --> 01:41:08,980
that can teach three or four, that teach, for example,

1557
01:41:08,980 --> 01:41:12,820
physics, mathematics, and chemistry.

1558
01:41:12,820 --> 01:41:15,660
Math is not a science, but whatever.

1559
01:41:15,660 --> 01:41:19,460
And you need just some role models and tell these stories.

1560
01:41:19,460 --> 01:41:23,420
I don't think it's hard.

1561
01:41:23,420 --> 01:41:26,060
It's about motivating the people.

1562
01:41:26,060 --> 01:41:29,660
Especially when you're young, you

1563
01:41:29,660 --> 01:41:32,620
motivate by creating role models.

1564
01:41:32,620 --> 01:41:34,500
And you say, oh, look at that guy.

1565
01:41:34,500 --> 01:41:37,540
He doesn't have much money, but he's a superstar.

1566
01:41:37,540 --> 01:41:43,820
Like, he's, I don't know, that's at least how I came here

1567
01:41:43,820 --> 01:41:46,740
to MIT was because there was a guy that was really, really

1568
01:41:46,740 --> 01:41:49,140
smart, two years older than me.

1569
01:41:49,140 --> 01:41:55,620
And he was famous in high school because of being here.

1570
01:41:56,620 --> 01:42:02,100
Well, I think the Chinese has perfected their art.

1571
01:42:02,100 --> 01:42:06,100
In my middle school, it's a culture

1572
01:42:06,100 --> 01:42:14,580
that very much has invaded every high school, every household,

1573
01:42:14,580 --> 01:42:19,060
to motivate people to study really hard, setting up role

1574
01:42:19,060 --> 01:42:23,540
models, and just, like, be able to use them.

1575
01:42:23,580 --> 01:42:25,700
Are they science-oriented?

1576
01:42:25,700 --> 01:42:31,540
They're science-oriented, and not only do they work really

1577
01:42:31,540 --> 01:42:35,980
hard, try to achieve, like you said,

1578
01:42:35,980 --> 01:42:38,980
they don't have a lot of money, whatever,

1579
01:42:38,980 --> 01:42:40,380
but they're superstars.

1580
01:42:40,380 --> 01:42:44,100
Not only do they believe in that, they also believe in,

1581
01:42:44,100 --> 01:42:48,940
it's OK if you try very hard and then fail at the end.

1582
01:42:48,940 --> 01:42:50,820
That's OK also.

1583
01:42:50,820 --> 01:42:55,220
So a ton of people are going to really hard math and science

1584
01:42:55,220 --> 01:42:59,020
training and coming out, failing because the competition is

1585
01:42:59,020 --> 01:43:01,420
just so intense.

1586
01:43:01,420 --> 01:43:09,420
But people still do it anyway, and they devote a lot of years

1587
01:43:09,420 --> 01:43:12,420
and lives into it.

1588
01:43:12,420 --> 01:43:20,740
I think that probably the best way

1589
01:43:20,740 --> 01:43:27,860
that people love hard problems is to, from childhood,

1590
01:43:27,860 --> 01:43:33,900
raise them in communities where all their peers are all

1591
01:43:33,900 --> 01:43:38,140
into science, because that's what they're into.

1592
01:43:38,140 --> 01:43:42,700
I had this experience of switching between on Long

1593
01:43:42,700 --> 01:43:44,700
Island, switching between high schools,

1594
01:43:44,700 --> 01:43:46,540
switching between junior high.

1595
01:43:46,540 --> 01:43:49,940
I was at a junior high for literally three miles away

1596
01:43:50,140 --> 01:43:52,140
from the junior high where I ended up finishing.

1597
01:43:52,140 --> 01:43:56,140
And the whole atmosphere of the first junior high

1598
01:43:56,140 --> 01:43:57,140
was just awful.

1599
01:43:57,140 --> 01:44:03,140
It was just these, no one cooled into science.

1600
01:44:03,140 --> 01:44:10,140
And so it was very, when you create people where the norm

1601
01:44:10,140 --> 01:44:13,140
is people who are math, science nerds,

1602
01:44:13,140 --> 01:44:19,140
if you create more of those places where they self-label

1603
01:44:19,340 --> 01:44:23,340
that way, people who are kind of on the edge,

1604
01:44:23,340 --> 01:44:26,340
people like, should I do math and science?

1605
01:44:26,340 --> 01:44:30,340
Or should I just make music or something

1606
01:44:30,340 --> 01:44:32,340
for the rest of my life?

1607
01:44:32,340 --> 01:44:36,340
They'll be more likely to just get swept up in that.

1608
01:44:36,340 --> 01:44:39,340
I think you need a place to be socialized

1609
01:44:39,340 --> 01:44:41,340
to be interested in math.

1610
01:44:41,540 --> 01:44:50,540
Let's ask a question of how much does what you're learning

1611
01:44:50,540 --> 01:44:53,540
interact with real life?

1612
01:44:53,540 --> 01:44:58,540
I went to a high school of science, which was great.

1613
01:44:58,540 --> 01:45:05,540
I remember in grade school, science was really nice.

1614
01:45:05,540 --> 01:45:08,540
And of course, it was pretty hard sometimes.

1615
01:45:09,340 --> 01:45:11,900
But then there are other things like history,

1616
01:45:11,900 --> 01:45:13,420
and that was incredibly hard.

1617
01:45:17,220 --> 01:45:19,500
How come some kids don't find history

1618
01:45:19,500 --> 01:45:22,380
is completely incomprehensible?

1619
01:45:22,380 --> 01:45:26,300
Makes no sense, and you can't figure out

1620
01:45:26,300 --> 01:45:30,360
what will happen next except by looking it up.

1621
01:45:30,360 --> 01:45:31,820
And how come most of the children

1622
01:45:31,820 --> 01:45:36,460
don't realize that this is too hard to pay any attention to?

1623
01:45:36,860 --> 01:45:40,860
I think they do realize it, but they don't pay attention to it.

1624
01:45:40,860 --> 01:45:42,460
Do most people hate history?

1625
01:45:42,460 --> 01:45:43,340
I think so.

1626
01:45:43,340 --> 01:45:43,840
Oh, good.

1627
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:44,820
What was that, really?

1628
01:45:44,820 --> 01:45:47,260
I'm sorry.

1629
01:45:47,260 --> 01:45:49,980
I thought people took it for granted.

1630
01:45:49,980 --> 01:45:53,420
And I don't know, when I took history,

1631
01:45:53,420 --> 01:45:55,780
I think what I got out most from that class

1632
01:45:55,780 --> 01:45:59,860
wasn't the history itself, but rather how to frame ideas

1633
01:45:59,860 --> 01:46:02,660
and how to make a good argument and support it

1634
01:46:02,660 --> 01:46:04,500
and how to write a good paper, which are

1635
01:46:04,500 --> 01:46:06,460
kind of essential life skills.

1636
01:46:06,460 --> 01:46:08,460
Right, but even the best argument

1637
01:46:08,460 --> 01:46:15,540
isn't very good in that field, so it's very tough.

1638
01:46:15,540 --> 01:46:19,180
Well, I guess if it's hard to find exceptions,

1639
01:46:19,180 --> 01:46:25,580
then that gets interesting, even if the thing is wrong.

1640
01:46:25,580 --> 01:46:28,460
I'm not sure what I'm saying.

1641
01:46:28,460 --> 01:46:34,860
But if a subject has the word science in it,

1642
01:46:34,860 --> 01:46:39,780
it isn't social science and things.

1643
01:46:39,780 --> 01:46:42,540
I think with the issue of science,

1644
01:46:42,540 --> 01:46:45,660
there's no one solution of how to get people

1645
01:46:45,660 --> 01:46:47,300
motivated in science, right?

1646
01:46:47,300 --> 01:46:49,380
But there are several different factors.

1647
01:46:49,380 --> 01:46:52,220
So one factor is definitely the idea

1648
01:46:52,220 --> 01:46:55,260
of having a social support network,

1649
01:46:55,260 --> 01:46:58,060
whether it's teachers who support you

1650
01:46:58,060 --> 01:47:01,260
and also having peers who don't make fun of you

1651
01:47:01,260 --> 01:47:03,820
and ostracize you for liking science and that.

1652
01:47:03,820 --> 01:47:04,700
That's one.

1653
01:47:04,700 --> 01:47:08,300
Two, I think the curriculum itself also

1654
01:47:08,300 --> 01:47:09,460
has something to do with it.

1655
01:47:09,460 --> 01:47:11,300
As you said, I think it helps more

1656
01:47:11,300 --> 01:47:14,900
when people can connect it better to the real world,

1657
01:47:14,900 --> 01:47:15,900
to life.

1658
01:47:15,900 --> 01:47:20,780
And I think it also helps more when people are sort of allowed

1659
01:47:20,780 --> 01:47:23,420
a bit of creativity, if you will,

1660
01:47:23,420 --> 01:47:27,700
when they're not stuck doing growth problems all the time.

1661
01:47:27,700 --> 01:47:30,380
And I think another issue is sort

1662
01:47:30,380 --> 01:47:34,540
of presenting problems and solutions and lessons

1663
01:47:34,540 --> 01:47:37,660
to students in such a way that they're sufficiently

1664
01:47:37,660 --> 01:47:40,500
challenged, but they're not discouraged

1665
01:47:40,500 --> 01:47:42,620
because it's too difficult. And on the other hand,

1666
01:47:42,620 --> 01:47:46,540
they're not bored because it's too repetitive.

1667
01:47:46,540 --> 01:47:49,580
So I think it's sort of like a delicate balance, right?

1668
01:47:49,580 --> 01:47:52,740
All these factors must be there.

1669
01:47:52,740 --> 01:47:57,300
Yeah, and that also relates to the hour problem,

1670
01:47:57,300 --> 01:48:02,940
like when can you give someone a problem that

1671
01:48:02,940 --> 01:48:07,140
might take a whole day or two?

1672
01:48:07,140 --> 01:48:13,500
And there's no place for that in, well, there must be.

1673
01:48:13,500 --> 01:48:15,980
Where in school do you get, that's

1674
01:48:15,980 --> 01:48:19,820
when you have to write a term paper, maybe.

1675
01:48:19,820 --> 01:48:22,780
And I think another thing about science and math,

1676
01:48:22,780 --> 01:48:26,900
perhaps, at least the grade school incarnations

1677
01:48:26,900 --> 01:48:29,340
of those subjects, is that they tend

1678
01:48:29,340 --> 01:48:34,340
to be a lot more isolating than subjects in the humanities,

1679
01:48:34,340 --> 01:48:37,620
in the sense that when you're stuck at home doing science

1680
01:48:37,620 --> 01:48:39,620
and math problems, you're always by yourself.

1681
01:48:39,620 --> 01:48:44,940
And you're always encouraged to essentially quarantine

1682
01:48:44,940 --> 01:48:48,460
yourself to study these things and come up with solutions.

1683
01:48:48,460 --> 01:48:52,860
Whereas classes in history or foreign languages or English

1684
01:48:52,860 --> 01:48:55,260
are more like discussion space.

1685
01:48:55,260 --> 01:48:57,620
And actually, I think that's sort of, I don't know,

1686
01:48:57,620 --> 01:49:00,020
because in real life, when you solve scientific problems,

1687
01:49:00,020 --> 01:49:02,100
you are working on a team a lot of the time.

1688
01:49:02,100 --> 01:49:04,380
And you have to communicate your ideas.

1689
01:49:04,380 --> 01:49:06,540
And you kind of are working together.

1690
01:49:06,540 --> 01:49:08,940
But somehow, in grade school, you're

1691
01:49:08,940 --> 01:49:12,780
stuck working on these problems by yourself.

1692
01:49:12,780 --> 01:49:15,500
I think that might also be a contributing factor.

1693
01:49:15,500 --> 01:49:17,540
Interesting.

1694
01:49:17,540 --> 01:49:22,500
Well, if you try to solve a geometry problem,

1695
01:49:22,500 --> 01:49:26,820
have you ever solved a problem working with someone else?

1696
01:49:26,820 --> 01:49:27,420
Does it help?

1697
01:49:27,420 --> 01:49:31,580
Or are they always interrupting you so you can't concentrate?

1698
01:49:31,580 --> 01:49:35,780
In undergrad, for instance, there will be office hours

1699
01:49:35,780 --> 01:49:39,060
or open office hours where students all come together

1700
01:49:39,060 --> 01:49:43,220
and help each other a little or give hints, things like that.

1701
01:49:43,220 --> 01:49:47,060
And it tends to help for at least most people.

1702
01:49:47,060 --> 01:49:50,740
But I guess I'm mostly encountering the other people

1703
01:49:50,740 --> 01:49:54,220
who go to these things.

1704
01:49:54,220 --> 01:49:56,380
I think in grade school, it's too,

1705
01:49:56,380 --> 01:50:00,060
one, the problems that you have to master are too simple.

1706
01:50:02,940 --> 01:50:07,220
It only requires one flash of insight to solve the problem.

1707
01:50:07,220 --> 01:50:09,060
And that flash of insight you're supposed

1708
01:50:09,060 --> 01:50:10,860
to work towards on your own.

1709
01:50:10,860 --> 01:50:15,620
Whereas if there's a problem that takes a day to solve,

1710
01:50:15,620 --> 01:50:18,940
that takes five flashes of insight,

1711
01:50:18,940 --> 01:50:22,580
consecutive flashes of insight to solve it,

1712
01:50:22,580 --> 01:50:24,380
then it's a collaborative.

1713
01:50:24,380 --> 01:50:25,540
OK, here's a problem.

1714
01:50:35,540 --> 01:50:36,700
There's an isosceles.

1715
01:50:36,700 --> 01:50:38,700
These two sides are equal.

1716
01:50:38,700 --> 01:50:40,340
So that's an isosceles triangle.

1717
01:50:41,340 --> 01:50:49,580
So now, here are two angle bisectors.

1718
01:50:56,500 --> 01:50:59,580
So if the triangle is isosceles, prove

1719
01:50:59,580 --> 01:51:01,660
that the angle bisectors are equal.

1720
01:51:05,220 --> 01:51:06,860
Has anybody proved it yet?

1721
01:51:11,340 --> 01:51:13,140
Well, it's very easy.

1722
01:51:15,580 --> 01:51:18,540
But here's your homework.

1723
01:51:18,540 --> 01:51:22,820
If you have a triangle and the angle bisectors are equal,

1724
01:51:22,820 --> 01:51:27,460
prove that the corresponding sides are equal.

1725
01:51:27,460 --> 01:51:31,580
And see who can get the shortest proof.

1726
01:51:31,580 --> 01:51:33,100
It's pretty hard.

1727
01:51:33,100 --> 01:51:35,780
Have you ever read the essay by Paul Lockhart

1728
01:51:35,780 --> 01:51:39,180
called A Mathematician's Limit?

1729
01:51:39,180 --> 01:51:40,540
What's the third word?

1730
01:51:40,540 --> 01:51:42,860
A mathematician's lament.

1731
01:51:42,860 --> 01:51:43,620
Living?

1732
01:51:43,620 --> 01:51:44,580
Lament.

1733
01:51:44,580 --> 01:51:45,900
Lament.

1734
01:51:45,900 --> 01:51:47,700
No, I don't think so.

1735
01:51:47,700 --> 01:51:50,980
It's sort of his critique on math education in America.

1736
01:51:50,980 --> 01:51:53,820
It's quite interesting.

1737
01:51:53,820 --> 01:51:56,020
Yeah, I was just thinking that, well,

1738
01:51:56,020 --> 01:51:59,780
you mentioned that mathematics tends to be pretty slow.

1739
01:51:59,780 --> 01:52:02,820
But Marvin brought up that, and I

1740
01:52:02,820 --> 01:52:07,740
was thinking that for many kinds of mathematical problems,

1741
01:52:07,740 --> 01:52:13,700
you can prove theorems in different ways.

1742
01:52:13,700 --> 01:52:17,020
And then somebody comes up with a proof,

1743
01:52:17,020 --> 01:52:21,180
and then you challenge that, OK, now somebody else

1744
01:52:21,180 --> 01:52:22,940
finds another kind of proof.

1745
01:52:22,940 --> 01:52:23,740
Better, please.

1746
01:52:23,740 --> 01:52:26,020
You can have a homework of, OK, come up

1747
01:52:26,020 --> 01:52:28,820
with four different ways of proving this thing.

1748
01:52:28,820 --> 01:52:32,780
And always, everything goes.

1749
01:52:32,780 --> 01:52:35,060
So if you want to work together with people,

1750
01:52:35,060 --> 01:52:37,700
you can pull out your proofs.

1751
01:52:37,700 --> 01:52:44,380
So that's why Feynman said he was so great.

1752
01:52:44,380 --> 01:52:47,060
That is, when he had a physics problem,

1753
01:52:47,060 --> 01:52:51,020
he forced himself to find several different ways.

1754
01:52:51,020 --> 01:52:52,580
And he said all of his friends, when

1755
01:52:52,580 --> 01:52:57,100
they learned quantum mechanics, either learned the Heisenberg

1756
01:52:57,100 --> 01:53:05,260
matrix method or the Schrodinger differential equation method

1757
01:53:05,260 --> 01:53:08,700
or the Dirac technique.

1758
01:53:08,700 --> 01:53:12,740
And whenever he had a problem, he

1759
01:53:12,740 --> 01:53:16,780
would solve it by all known techniques.

1760
01:53:16,780 --> 01:53:20,100
And then in later life, he rarely

1761
01:53:20,100 --> 01:53:23,420
got stuck where most people did.

1762
01:53:23,420 --> 01:53:24,100
Yeah?

1763
01:53:24,100 --> 01:53:30,420
So related to that, the best mathematicians that I know

1764
01:53:30,420 --> 01:53:33,420
are people that they stay with a problem,

1765
01:53:33,420 --> 01:53:36,900
and they solve by themselves.

1766
01:53:36,900 --> 01:53:39,860
They don't go and look for the solution

1767
01:53:39,860 --> 01:53:41,940
or ask other people.

1768
01:53:41,940 --> 01:53:43,460
They try to solve it by themselves.

1769
01:53:43,460 --> 01:53:45,300
And I believe it's just because of the way

1770
01:53:45,300 --> 01:53:48,180
we created pathways.

1771
01:53:48,180 --> 01:53:50,620
I believe that's a-

1772
01:53:50,620 --> 01:53:54,420
But there are quite a few pairs of mathematicians.

1773
01:53:54,420 --> 01:53:58,260
Yeah, but when you're young, you should

1774
01:53:58,260 --> 01:54:00,300
try to solve the problems by yourself,

1775
01:54:00,300 --> 01:54:02,820
at least when you're in middle school or high school.

1776
01:54:02,820 --> 01:54:04,740
And then you create these pathways.

1777
01:54:04,740 --> 01:54:06,100
Right.

1778
01:54:06,100 --> 01:54:10,020
Maybe when you get older, the problems are too hard.

1779
01:54:10,020 --> 01:54:15,740
And then it doesn't help to solve the problem by yourself,

1780
01:54:15,740 --> 01:54:18,460
because you're not going to solve harder problems

1781
01:54:18,460 --> 01:54:19,860
than those ones.

1782
01:54:24,660 --> 01:54:26,300
How many of you have ever solved a math

1783
01:54:26,300 --> 01:54:29,380
problem with someone else?

1784
01:54:29,380 --> 01:54:31,660
Quite a few.

1785
01:54:31,660 --> 01:54:33,260
It seemed like they could solve it.

1786
01:54:37,260 --> 01:54:40,340
I remember being in a boat with Seymour Papert,

1787
01:54:40,340 --> 01:54:42,260
solving some really hard problem.

1788
01:54:45,780 --> 01:54:50,500
And after a while, he got tired of it

1789
01:54:50,500 --> 01:54:55,660
and slipped into the water and went swimming around.

1790
01:54:55,660 --> 01:55:00,300
And I said, come back.

1791
01:55:00,300 --> 01:55:01,100
He said, why?

1792
01:55:01,100 --> 01:55:04,100
And I said, I'll tell you when you get here.

1793
01:55:04,100 --> 01:55:07,020
And he got back before the shark.

1794
01:55:07,020 --> 01:55:10,980
Did I ever tell you about it?

1795
01:55:10,980 --> 01:55:15,300
We thought it was a dolphin for a while.

1796
01:55:15,300 --> 01:55:18,540
But it had this fin on the back that didn't seem quite right.

1797
01:55:18,540 --> 01:55:19,040
OK.

1798
01:55:24,620 --> 01:55:28,500
Anyway, I did a lot of solving with.

1799
01:55:31,220 --> 01:55:34,660
I don't remember ever solving a hard problem with three people.

1800
01:55:43,660 --> 01:55:46,340
That's nice.

1801
01:55:46,340 --> 01:55:53,100
Well, you have to see 436 problem of the necessary height.

1802
01:55:53,100 --> 01:55:54,420
It says low battery.

1803
01:55:54,420 --> 01:55:55,580
Is that a coincidence?

1804
01:56:01,500 --> 01:56:04,820
Oh, ringing the bell must have dropped the voltage.

1805
01:56:10,700 --> 01:56:13,420
The low battery went on about one second

1806
01:56:13,420 --> 01:56:16,740
after I stopped the quack.
