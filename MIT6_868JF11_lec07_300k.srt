8
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,600
What do you think AI people should work on next?

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,440
You know what question I was going to ask you before you

10
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,800
said your question?

11
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,080
Oh, OK.

12
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,520
I was going to ask you, what kind of questions

13
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,240
do you think that AI people should be asking right now?

14
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:52,840
That's right.

15
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,240
Anybody have a meta question?

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:26,280
One good question is, I could focus it better,

17
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:35,080
but or make it bigger.

18
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,800
Is that enough layers?

19
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:54,440
It's possible that I got the idea from Sigmund Freud

20
00:01:54,440 --> 00:02:07,560
that who knows what Sigmund Freud's three layers were?

21
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,560
Sure.

22
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,720
Ego, superego?

23
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,200
Right here.

24
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,680
Ego, superego.

25
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,400
Freud wrote about 30 books, I know,

26
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,360
because I had a graduate student once who

27
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:39,000
decided to quit computer science and go

28
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,840
into emergency medicine.

29
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,840
He had an MD, which he wasn't using,

30
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:51,240
and he suddenly got fed up with computer science.

31
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,840
So he sold me his set of Freud books, which

32
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:22,440
is, but in Freud's vision, these don't seem to be a stack,

33
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:35,240
but this thing, which is basic instincts,

34
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:44,160
I shouldn't say basic, maybe to a large extent built in.

35
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:53,400
And this is learned socially.

36
00:03:53,400 --> 00:04:15,760
And I think the nice thing about Freud's concept, which

37
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,800
as far as I know doesn't appear much in earlier psychology,

38
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,800
is that these conflict.

39
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:33,920
And when a child grows up, a lot of what we call civilization

40
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,200
or socialization or whatever comes

41
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:42,640
from taking the built-in instincts, which

42
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,440
is, if you see something you like, take it,

43
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:55,440
and the social constraints that say you should negotiate.

44
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,080
And if you want something someone else has,

45
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,960
you should fool them into wanting to give it to you

46
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,640
or whatever.

47
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:18,640
So in fact, when I make this big stack of mechanisms,

48
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:30,120
that really, well, that's actually not the organization

49
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:36,720
that the book starts to develop chapter

50
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:50,720
by chapter, which was instincts, learned reactions, and so

51
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,720
forth up to self-conscious.

52
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,320
What's the next to top layer?

53
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,440
What?

54
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,160
I've forgotten.

55
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,640
Self-ideology.

56
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,000
Yeah, I guess so.

57
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,400
It's hard to tell.

58
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:22,680
The reason I had six layers is that,

59
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:28,080
unlike what people do when making theories in science,

60
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:35,080
is I assume that whatever ideas I have, they're not enough.

61
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:41,160
That is, instead of trying to reduce the mind to as few

62
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:47,320
mechanisms as possible, I think you want to leave room.

63
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,400
If your theory is to live for a few years,

64
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,200
you want to leave room for new ideas.

65
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,920
So the last three layers, beginning

66
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:03,640
with reflective thought and self-reflective and the ideals,

67
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:07,320
it's hard to imagine any clear boundaries.

68
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:12,360
And at some point, when you make your own theory,

69
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:20,120
maybe you can squeeze it into these extra boxes that I have.

70
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:27,760
A little later in the book, another hierarchy appears.

71
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:43,200
And this is imagining as a functional diagram

72
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:48,640
to show how knowledge or skills or abilities

73
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:52,280
or whatever you want to call them,

74
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:57,200
the things that people do, might be arranged.

75
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:04,380
And as far as I know, because virtually every psychologist

76
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:10,760
in the last 100 years has suffered from physics envy,

77
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:17,080
they want to make something like Newton's laws,

78
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,840
the result has been that, except for the work of people

79
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:25,160
like Newell and Simon and other pioneers

80
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:32,880
who started research in artificial intelligence,

81
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,840
you've heard me complain about neuroscientists.

82
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,520
But there's pretty much the same complaint

83
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:42,400
to be leveled against most cognitive scientists who,

84
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:48,240
for example, try to say maybe the entire human mind is

85
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,640
a collection of rules and if-then rules.

86
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,860
Well, in some sense, you could make anything out

87
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,540
of if-then rules.

88
00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:01,580
But the chances are, if you tried

89
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:04,700
to make a learning machine that just

90
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:11,820
tried to add rules in some beautifully general fashion,

91
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,380
I suspect the chances are it would learn for a while

92
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,160
and then get stuck.

93
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,300
And indeed, that's what happened maybe five or six times

94
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:24,180
in the history of artificial intelligence.

95
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:30,620
Doug Lennat's system called AM, Automated Mathematician,

96
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,480
was a wonderful PhD thesis.

97
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:39,720
And it learned arithmetic completely by itself.

98
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:44,060
He just set up the thing biased so

99
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:48,580
that it would have some concept of numbers,

100
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:53,440
like six is the successor of five and stuff like that.

101
00:09:53,440 --> 00:10:00,440
And it fooled around and discovered various regularities.

102
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,320
I think I mentioned it the other day.

103
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,840
It first developed a concept of number,

104
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:13,440
which wasn't very hard because he wrote the whole thing

105
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,840
in the AI language called Lisp.

106
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,400
How many of you know Lisp?

107
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,200
That's a lot.

108
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:27,920
In looking at the biographies of the late John McCarthy

109
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:34,960
all week, there were lots of attempts by the writers

110
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,080
to say what Lisp was.

111
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,800
The tragedy is you probably could have described it

112
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:49,040
exactly in a paragraph because it's

113
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:55,200
saying that each structure has two parts,

114
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,000
and each of those has two parts.

115
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,720
I don't remember seeing any attempt

116
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,720
to say something about this programming language in.

117
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,800
Yes?

118
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:13,040
How do you imagine the layers interact with each other?

119
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,320
Those?

120
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:19,400
Yeah, those and the six layers.

121
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,840
I think they're layers of organization.

122
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:42,920
Yes, because a trance frame is made of two frames.

123
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:48,960
But then if there were a neuroscientist who said,

124
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:54,600
oh, maybe when you see an apple and you're hungry,

125
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,960
you reach out and eat it.

126
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,280
You could think of that as a simple reflex.

127
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,680
If this, then that.

128
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:11,440
Or you could say, if I'm hungry now

129
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,120
and I want to be not hungry, what's a possible action

130
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:15,880
could I do?

131
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:21,840
And that action might be look for an apple or yes?

132
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,880
So I was teaching my class on the day

133
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,920
that McCarthy passed away, and then I was explaining.

134
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,400
And then I had some students in the class of learning,

135
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,360
computer scientists.

136
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,200
And so I was thinking about the same problem,

137
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,240
which is how do I explain what Lisp was.

138
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,480
So I said, well, before that, there

139
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,520
were languages like Fortran that manipulated numbers.

140
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,360
Lisp was the fourth first language to manipulate ideas.

141
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:52,760
Yes, it can manipulate representations of.

142
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:56,360
Yes, it's manipulating the ideas that are represented

143
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,760
by these expressions.

144
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:04,240
And one thing that interests me is

145
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,240
another analog between psychology

146
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:14,080
and modern cognitive psychology and computer science

147
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:24,160
or artificial intelligence is the idea of a goal where,

148
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,600
what does it mean to have a goal?

149
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,840
And you could say, it's a piece of machinery

150
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:37,880
which says that if there's a situation, what you have now,

151
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:44,160
and if you have a representation of some future thing,

152
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,040
what you want.

153
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:53,580
So of course, at any time you're in a situation

154
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:57,880
that your brain is somehow representing maybe

155
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,840
five or 10 ways, not just one.

156
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:04,760
But what does it mean to have a goal?

157
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:08,280
And what it means is to have two representations.

158
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,880
One is a representation you've made

159
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:15,040
of some structure which says what things are like now.

160
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,320
And the other is some representation

161
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,880
of what you want.

162
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:26,760
And I don't think I need that.

163
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,520
And the important thing is, what are the differences?

164
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,640
And instead of saying, what's the difference,

165
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:46,040
maybe it's good to say, what are the differences?

166
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,640
So what does it mean to have a goal?

167
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:54,580
It means to have some piece of machinery turned on.

168
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:57,400
You can imagine a goal that you don't have, right?

169
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:01,360
Like I can say, what's David's goal?

170
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,840
It's to get people to go to that meeting.

171
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:15,160
So what you want is to minimize the differences between what

172
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,960
you have and what you want.

173
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,520
And so there has to be a machinery which does what?

174
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,880
It picks out one of these differences

175
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,840
and tries to get rid of it.

176
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,680
And how can you get rid of it?

177
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,760
There's two ways.

178
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,920
The good way is to change the situation

179
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,280
so that difference disappears.

180
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:45,800
The other way is to say, oh, that would take a year.

181
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,200
I should give up that goal.

182
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:53,560
And I'm digressing.

183
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:58,240
So you want something that removes,

184
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,880
the feedback has to go this way.

185
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:10,920
Let's change the world and get rid of that difference.

186
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:16,480
So well, how do you get rid of a difference?

187
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,220
That depends on maybe you have a built-in reflex,

188
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:28,940
like if you have too much CO2 in your blood,

189
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:32,580
something senses it and tells you to breathe.

190
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,620
So you've got built-in things.

191
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:45,340
And the question is, how do you represent these sorts of things?

192
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,920
And in fact, I think I got a lot of this idea

193
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,580
from the PhD thesis of Patrick Winston, who

194
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,780
was here a minute ago.

195
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:07,620
But the question is, how do you represent what you want,

196
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:11,300
and how do you represent what you have?

197
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:15,740
And I think the big difference between people

198
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:21,680
and other primates and reptiles and amphibians, reptiles, fish,

199
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:25,340
and going back to plants and so forth

200
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:33,960
is that we have these very high-level, powerful waves

201
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,080
of representing differences between things.

202
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:43,900
And this enables us to develop reflexes for getting

203
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,340
rid of the differences.

204
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:50,220
So this is what I think might be a picture of how

205
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,940
the brain is organized.

206
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:55,100
And at every level, these things are made of neurons.

207
00:17:55,100 --> 00:18:00,580
But you shouldn't be looking at the neurons individually

208
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,060
to see how the brain works.

209
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:07,200
It's like looking at a computer and saying,

210
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,720
oh, I understand that.

211
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,340
All I have to do is know a great deal about how

212
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,620
each transistor works.

213
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:16,380
The great thing about a computer is

214
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:19,900
that it doesn't matter how the transistor works.

215
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,500
The important thing is to recognize,

216
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:27,020
oh, look, they usually come in pairs, or really 4 or 10

217
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:30,340
or whatever, called a flip-flop.

218
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:38,500
And do you ever see a neuroscientist saying,

219
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,660
where are the flip-flops in this or that?

220
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,140
Very strange.

221
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:46,660
As though they're trying to develop

222
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:50,420
a very powerful computer without using any concepts

223
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,780
from computer science.

224
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,420
It's a marvelous phenomenon.

225
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:59,700
And you have to wonder, where did they grow up

226
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:03,500
and how did they stay isolated?

227
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,620
In biology departments, I think.

228
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,140
Biology departments.

229
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:10,140
Or psychology departments.

230
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,580
Well, I started out in biology pretty much.

231
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:20,340
And then I ran across these early papers, one of which

232
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:28,100
was by Letvin and McCulloch and Pitts and people like that.

233
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:33,620
In the early 1940s, the idea of symbolic neurons appeared.

234
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:42,660
It had first appeared in 1895 or so with the paper

235
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:46,900
that Sigmund Freud wrote, but couldn't get published.

236
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,140
I think I mentioned that, called Project

237
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:52,460
for a Scientific Psychology.

238
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:56,980
And it had the idea of neurons with various levels

239
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,660
of activation.

240
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:01,240
And sometimes you would have a pair of them,

241
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,720
and one would be inhibiting the other.

242
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,800
And so that could store some information.

243
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,840
And he's not very explicit about how these things might work.

244
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:15,680
But as far as I know, it's about the first attempt

245
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:20,280
to have a biological theory of information processing at all.

246
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:26,520
And he was unable to get it published.

247
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:27,980
Yeah?

248
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:31,160
Well, since McCarthy did this, just

249
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,480
do you have any summary reflections on the stuff

250
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,640
that he did or his contributions?

251
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,320
There are a lot of things that he did.

252
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:47,520
And I noticed that none of the obituaries

253
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,440
actually had any background.

254
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:54,520
What had happened is that Newell and Simon

255
00:20:54,520 --> 00:21:01,520
had started to make, they had struggled

256
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,840
to make programs that could do symbolic logic.

257
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:12,480
And they made a language called IPL.

258
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:24,360
And IPL was a language of very microscopic operations,

259
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:33,920
like you have several registers, put a symbol in a register,

260
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,640
perhaps do a piece of arithmetic on two symbols

261
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,480
if they're numbers.

262
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:44,760
If not, link up.

263
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:49,040
You could sort of make registers artificially

264
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,880
in the memory of the computer.

265
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,000
And you could take two or three registers,

266
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:00,160
and it had instructions for making lists or trees.

267
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:04,680
So you could arrange these in a way that.

268
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,480
So here are the three things.

269
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,560
And this is just a simple list.

270
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,720
But I've drawn it as though these two

271
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,520
were subsidiary to that.

272
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,920
Of course, that depends on what program

273
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,920
is going to look at this.

274
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,960
And you could have a program which

275
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:29,600
can say, here are two arguments for a function.

276
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,480
And it doesn't matter what order they're in.

277
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,840
It just depends how you wrote the function.

278
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:38,120
So Newell and Simon had written a programming language which

279
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,480
said put something in a register,

280
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:46,320
link it to another register, and then perform

281
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,560
the usual arithmetic operations.

282
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,400
In fact, what they were doing is mostly

283
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,680
performing logical operations.

284
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:56,200
Because even the early computers had

285
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,000
ANDs and ORs and XORs and things like that.

286
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:11,480
So I'm trying to remember what they were using.

287
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:14,600
Oh, so Newell and Simon had written

288
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:20,400
a program that could deal with Boolean functions

289
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:29,680
and prove little theorems about not A or B is not A or not B.

290
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,400
Is that wrong?

291
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,640
I forget.

292
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,920
Should have more nots.

293
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:41,000
Anyway, they wrote this beautiful but clumsy thing

294
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,560
made of very simple logical primitives.

295
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:51,200
McCarthy, at the same time, IBM had spent 400 man years

296
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:56,280
writing a program called Fortran 1 or Fortran.

297
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:59,600
I'm not sure that people had serial numbers on programming

298
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,280
languages yet, because we're talking

299
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:06,600
about the middle 1950s.

300
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,200
And McCarthy had been thinking about how

301
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:14,320
would you make AI programs that could do symbolic reasoning.

302
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,960
And he was, indeed, particularly interested in logic.

303
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,400
Backtrack.

304
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:26,920
In fact, Newell and Simon had got their program

305
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,760
to find proofs of most of the theorems

306
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,800
in the first volume of Russell and Whitehead's Principia

307
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:40,440
Mathematica, which is a huge two-volume book from about 1905,

308
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:47,600
I think, which was the first successful attempt

309
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,080
to reduce mathematics to logic.

310
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,040
And they managed to get up to calculus

311
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:56,620
and show that differentiation and integration

312
00:24:56,620 --> 00:25:00,760
can be expressed as logical functions of variables.

313
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:07,840
It's a great tour de force, because logic itself

314
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,560
barely existed.

315
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:13,580
Boole and a few others, including Leibniz,

316
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:18,520
had invented Boolean algebra-like things.

317
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:26,440
And around Frege and others had got predicate calculus

318
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,840
with their exists and for all.

319
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,880
And that stuff was just appearing.

320
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,480
And Russell and Whitehead wrote this huge book,

321
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,280
which got all the way up to describing

322
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,760
continuous and differentiable functions and so forth.

323
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,320
The first volume was huge and just

324
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:47,280
did propositional calculus, which Aristotle

325
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,920
had done some of also.

326
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:55,080
And anyway, McCarthy looked at that and said,

327
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:59,840
why can't there be a functional language like Fortran that

328
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,080
can do symbolic reasoning?

329
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:06,760
And pretty much all by himself, he

330
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,240
got the basic ideas from Lisp.

331
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:12,320
They're built on the Newell and Simon experiment.

332
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:22,540
But he basically converted the symbolic system

333
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,500
into something like Fortran, which

334
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,280
was only able to manipulate numbers,

335
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:31,840
into Lisp, which was able to manipulate arbitrary symbols

336
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,440
in various ways.

337
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:40,640
And if you want to know more about that,

338
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:45,560
there's a great, you can find McCarthy's homepage

339
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:58,880
at Stanford just by, I think, if you Google search for McCarthy

340
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:06,200
and Sale, Sale is Stanford Artificial Intelligence

341
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,680
Laboratory.

342
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,320
And you'll get his homepage.

343
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:16,080
And there's a 1994 article about how he invented Lisp.

344
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,580
Yes?

345
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:21,000
Right after you started talking about Lisp, you jumped over

346
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,280
and you said, here's the now and the want,

347
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:27,600
which is the current state and the desired state.

348
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,240
And I think you were going for some kind of analogy

349
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:35,120
between the symbolic evaluation available in Lisp

350
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,960
and what conscious entities do.

351
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:41,040
However, one of the most beautiful things about Lisp

352
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,720
is the humoiconicity, the fact that you

353
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,600
have things such as macros.

354
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,240
What is there in the conscious entity that

355
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,160
is equivalent to the macro?

356
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:50,920
Macros?

357
00:27:51,920 --> 00:28:02,200
Well, each of these levels is, each of these levels

358
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,680
are ways of combining things at the previous level.

359
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:09,840
So that the way I drew it, at the top,

360
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:14,280
there are stories where you, what's a story?

361
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:21,040
You mentioned some characters in a typical story.

362
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,040
Then you say, and here's a problem

363
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,600
these characters encountered.

364
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:30,760
And here's what Joe did to solve the problem.

365
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,680
But it didn't work.

366
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,720
And here are the bugs.

367
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:41,360
And the reason it didn't work is that Mary was in the way.

368
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,920
So he killed her.

369
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,480
And then blah, blah, blah.

370
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:49,160
So that's what stories are.

371
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:54,200
If you just write a series of sentences, it's not a story,

372
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,480
even though the New Yorker managed

373
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:01,200
to make those into stories for about a period of 20 years.

374
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,880
But a typical story introduces a scene.

375
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,880
And it introduces a problem.

376
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,560
And then it produces a solution.

377
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,920
But the solution has a bug.

378
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:14,360
And then the rest of it is how you get around that bug

379
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:20,240
and how you maybe change the goals in the worst case.

380
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:25,560
So a story is a series of incidents.

381
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,240
I wonder if I brought my death ray.

382
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,160
Looks like I didn't.

383
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:46,760
Oh, but you don't need it with this.

384
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,080
You have to be here.

385
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,280
Anyway, but what's a story made of?

386
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,280
Well, there are situations.

387
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:11,400
And you do something, and you get a new situation.

388
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,520
So what's that?

389
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:18,160
That's what this thing I call the trance frame, which

390
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,680
is a pair of situations.

391
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:24,880
And OK, so what's an individual situation?

392
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:29,640
Well, it's a big network of nodes and relationships.

393
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:39,040
And I'm not sure why I have semantic networks down here

394
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:39,960
rather than here.

395
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:52,800
Oh, well, a frame is a collection of representations

396
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:58,040
that's sort of stereotyped or canned that

397
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:08,640
might have a single word like, oh, just about any word

398
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,520
breaking something.

399
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:18,120
If I say, John broke the X, you immediately say, oh,

400
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,720
that's a trance frame.

401
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:23,920
Here's an object that had certain properties, parts

402
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,360
and relationships.

403
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,280
And it's been replaced by this thing, which

404
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:32,560
has most of the same objects except

405
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:36,080
but different relationships or one of the objects is missing.

406
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,320
And it's been replaced by another frame and so forth.

407
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:45,840
So one question is, what's the relation?

408
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:50,920
So this is a picture of cognitive representations.

409
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,440
Everything is made of little parts.

410
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:59,320
And in the society of mind, I described

411
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:04,640
the idea of k-lines, which is what's a k-line.

412
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:09,160
It's an imaginary structure in the nervous system, which

413
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:12,120
is there's really two kinds.

414
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:17,120
There's a sort of perceptual k-line,

415
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:21,600
which is something that recognizes that, say,

416
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,800
10 features of a situation are present.

417
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:28,560
And if these are all present, then

418
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:33,700
a certain bunch of neurons or neural activity goes on.

419
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:38,400
And on the other hand, when you think of something

420
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:44,160
like a word, suppose I say microphone,

421
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:47,880
then you're likely to think of something

422
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,960
that has a business and which collects sounds.

423
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,920
And it has a stand, or maybe it has a handle.

424
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,040
And if you're an engineer, you know

425
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:00,960
that probably it has a battery or a transmitter or a wire.

426
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:09,920
So those are the things that I call frames or k-lines, really.

427
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:21,640
And anyway, this chapter 8 of The Emotion Machine

428
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,680
talks about that.

429
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:27,240
And there's a lot of detail in the old book, The Society

430
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:30,640
of Mind, about what k-lines and things like that

431
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,440
could be made of.

432
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:50,480
Now, whatever those are, and as far as I know,

433
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,000
no matter how hard you look, you won't

434
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:59,480
find any published theories of what in the nervous system

435
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:05,160
is used to represent the things above that sort of midline

436
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:12,280
there of cortical columns.

437
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:17,920
I suspect that almost everything that the human brain does,

438
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:25,180
that fish and those lower animals or earlier animals,

439
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:28,440
I should say, I'm not sure that higher and lower

440
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:36,920
makes any sense, are probably symbolic processes

441
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:40,800
where it probably does more harm than good

442
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,000
to have elaborate theories of what's

443
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,360
the physiological chemistry of neurons.

444
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:53,100
But at some point, we want to know what, in fact,

445
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,560
the brain is made of.

446
00:34:54,560 --> 00:35:00,720
The cortical column has a few hundred brain cells arranged.

447
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:06,760
And there are several projects around the world

448
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:09,200
trying to take electron microscopes

449
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,520
and pieces of mouse brain or cat brain

450
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:16,560
and make a huge connection matrix.

451
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:21,520
The problem is that the electron microscope,

452
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,560
even the electron microscope pictures still

453
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:29,400
aren't good enough to show you at each synapse what

454
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,320
is probably going on.

455
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,440
Eventually, people will get theories of that

456
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,600
and get slightly better instruments.

457
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,880
And I'm not sure that the present diagrams

458
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,440
that they're producing are going to be much used to anyone.

459
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,320
Yes, it's a nice question.

460
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:49,840
This question might be a little bit difficult.

461
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:55,280
So I'm going to start from the goal being a difference

462
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,640
between the now state and the desired state.

463
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,800
How do we reduce the difference?

464
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,720
Yeah, how do we get the difference?

465
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:12,240
So now I'm going to also take the fact of the animals

466
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,400
being different.

467
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:17,040
And I'd say that one of the biggest, big differences

468
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:21,720
is that we, as people, we cannot describe these differences.

469
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,840
It actually is only good for the recording.

470
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:32,040
OK, so we can describe these differences

471
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:36,760
and talk with them, talk about them with other people

472
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:42,320
without having to act on those goals or hypothetical goals.

473
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:46,280
So if everything that has to do with goals

474
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:51,880
is represented with a complex structure like this one,

475
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:57,160
and I want to implement it in a computer,

476
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:00,560
well, I can just, for every hypothetical case

477
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,320
that has to do with solving a certain problem,

478
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:06,320
I can just make more copies in the memory.

479
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:11,520
But if I have a human brain, then I

480
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:16,000
don't know how convenient it is to postulate

481
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,320
that there is a huge memory data bank where

482
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:23,760
you can make copies of everything that's going on.

483
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:29,120
Or if you have to assume some kind of a huge collection

484
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:32,560
of pointers and acting on those pointers.

485
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,600
So this is just a random point, and I'd

486
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:41,160
like to hear if you have any ideas on this.

487
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:57,140
That's an important question that we

488
00:37:57,140 --> 00:38:02,320
know quite a bit about the functions

489
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,760
of some parts of the brain.

490
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,440
And so if you, I don't think I've ever

491
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:14,560
tried to draw a brain, but there's

492
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,960
a structure called the amygdala.

493
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:19,960
How do you spell it?

494
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,960
I believe that means almond-shaped.

495
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:29,880
Is that right?

496
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:33,840
Anybody have a Google handy?

497
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:40,800
And that's down here somewhere, and it has the property

498
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,180
that it contains the short-term memories.

499
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:47,840
So anything that's happened in the last couple of seconds

500
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:55,260
is somehow represented here in a transient way.

501
00:38:55,260 --> 00:39:01,120
And everything that's happened in the last 20 minutes or so

502
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:04,720
leaves traces in the amygdala.

503
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,680
So that if somebody's in an automobile accident

504
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:15,960
or is knocked out by a real powerful boxing punch,

505
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:19,960
then when you wake up later, you can't

506
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:25,900
remember anything that happened in about 20 minutes or a half

507
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:29,520
hour before the trauma.

508
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:33,000
So that's a very good experiment to try.

509
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,760
And there's a lot of evidence that this

510
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:43,560
happens because the memories of the last half hour or so

511
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:47,320
are stored in the conjectures in a dynamic form.

512
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:50,520
Maybe there are huge numbers of loops

513
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:59,080
of neurons connected in circles or circle.

514
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:03,360
Anyway, nobody really knows, but if you

515
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:07,600
have a bunch of neurons connected in a big circle,

516
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,620
maybe 20 or 30 of them, then you can probably

517
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:16,440
put 10 or 20 bits of information in form

518
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,800
of different spaced pulses.

519
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,560
And a great mystery would be, how

520
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,840
does the brain manage to maintain

521
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:30,440
that particular pattern of pulses for 10 or 20 minutes?

522
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:36,800
Then no one knows where it goes after the 20 minutes.

523
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:42,360
But if a person gets enough sleep that night,

524
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:48,440
then it turns out that it's no longer in the amygdala,

525
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:51,000
and it's somewhere else in the brain.

526
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:58,120
So one question is, if there's all this stuff stored here,

527
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:02,240
and you might think of it as what's

528
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:06,600
happened in the primary memory, every computer

529
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:12,000
starts out with maybe just the first computers

530
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,560
had just two or three registers.

531
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,800
Then they got 16 and 32.

532
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,520
And I imagine, how many fast registers

533
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,760
are there in a modern computer?

534
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,880
I haven't been paying attention.

535
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,120
Maybe 64, maybe whatever.

536
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,040
Anyway, they're gone.

537
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:35,000
But the next day, if you've gotten some sleep,

538
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,240
you can retrieve them.

539
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:39,480
Somehow they're copied somewhere else.

540
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:42,100
As far as I know, there is no theory

541
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:45,860
of how the brain decides where to put them

542
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:48,640
and how it records it and so forth.

543
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:52,760
Something very strange about this big science lacking

544
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,840
theories, isn't there?

545
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,300
What would you do if you were in a profession where they're

546
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:04,240
talking about dozens and dozens of mechanisms which

547
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:07,800
clearly exist, and you say, how do you think that works?

548
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,880
And they say, well, I don't know.

549
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,640
None of my friends know either, so I guess it's OK.

550
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:21,640
So we don't know how it picks a place to put them.

551
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:24,640
And we don't know how, when you ask a question,

552
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,640
it gets back there so that you can reprocess it

553
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,920
and talk about it.

554
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:33,640
But anyway, so I made up these theories

555
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:36,600
that things are stored in the form of k lines.

556
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:43,080
And there's a lot of discussion in the society of mind

557
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:48,560
about how k lines probably have to work and so forth.

558
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:55,400
And if you look at the society of mind, in Amazon,

559
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:59,200
you'll find this enraging review by a neurologist named

560
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,040
Robert Restak, who says he introduces

561
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:06,360
these undefined terms called k lines and paradigms

562
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:09,280
and things like that, of which there's

563
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:12,200
whole chapters in the book.

564
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:21,360
So that's my favorite review of explaining

565
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:25,760
the problem of getting neuroscience to grow up.

566
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,760
Yes?

567
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,600
Who had a question?

568
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,920
Yes?

569
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:38,360
So one thing that troubles me is how do you think brain

570
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:41,520
decides to do things?

571
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:44,160
How do they decide what to do?

572
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,160
Did you say?

573
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:49,960
Say you want to relate a story.

574
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,800
But hundreds of things happen.

575
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,160
How do you select what to tell and what not to?

576
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:03,120
It seems like you need some sort of intentionality behind it.

577
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:08,760
But how do we learn to do that in the first place?

578
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:12,800
When you describe a goal, you describe what's going on now

579
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,160
and what's the thing you want.

580
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:24,000
But then how do you decide which few things to be considered?

581
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:29,440
Oh, you're asking a wonderful question, which is, after all,

582
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:35,720
if I were to talk to you for an hour about your goals,

583
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:39,320
you could tell me hundreds of goals that you have.

584
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:42,920
So the question is, how do you pick the one

585
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,960
that you're thinking about now?

586
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:51,960
Yeah, also, how do you represent the priority of goals?

587
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:55,840
Because they're almost described as the difference

588
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:58,600
machines that's turned on all the time.

589
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,960
But how do you resolve conflicts?

590
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,400
How do you decide which one to go first

591
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,920
and which one gets first?

592
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:10,880
How do you represent the relations of your goals?

593
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:15,240
The standard theory for which there is no evidence

594
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:20,640
is that, in fact, you use the word hierarchy.

595
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:24,600
So if you ask a naive person, they'll

596
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:28,080
give you a pretty good theory.

597
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:31,320
Completely wrong, but good.

598
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:35,240
And the standard theory says, well, there's

599
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:39,720
one big goal at the top.

600
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:40,680
And you say, what is it?

601
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:45,560
And some people would say, well, maybe it's to reproduce.

602
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:54,840
Darwin could but didn't argue that.

603
00:45:54,840 --> 00:46:08,040
Or to survive, or something like that.

604
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:11,200
So if you take that one, then it's

605
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:16,320
obvious what the next goals in the hierarchy would be.

606
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:18,560
I'm not saying this is how things work.

607
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,120
I don't think it does.

608
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:24,760
So there's food, and there's air.

609
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:33,640
Air gets very high priority.

610
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:37,720
If you put a pillow over somebody,

611
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:39,880
their first priority is to breathe,

612
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:44,680
and they don't even think about eating for a long time.

613
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:46,800
So that's very nice.

614
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:53,360
I don't know what comes after that.

615
00:46:53,360 --> 00:47:01,400
If you're out in the cold freezing, then there's temp.

616
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:05,640
The nice thing about air and temp

617
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:08,080
is that if you have those goals, you

618
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:10,360
can satisfy them in parallel.

619
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:13,600
Because, in fact, you don't need much of a hierarchy.

620
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:21,120
The breathing thing has this servomechanism where

621
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:25,840
if there's a higher level of CO2 than normal in your blood,

622
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:30,000
then the, what is it, the vagus nerve, or I don't know.

623
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,440
They know a lot about which part of the brain gets excited

624
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:37,420
and raises your breathing rate, or your heartbeat rate,

625
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:43,440
or my favorite animal is the swordfish.

626
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:51,000
Because how many of you know about brown fat?

627
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:01,480
Brown fat is a particular thing found in vertebrates,

628
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,480
and it's fat.

629
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:06,280
It's brown, I guess.

630
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:10,960
And it has the property that it can be innervated by nerve

631
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:17,120
fibers, and they cause it to start burning calories.

632
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:22,080
And the swordfish is normally cold blooded,

633
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:26,800
but its carotid arteries have a big organ of brown fat

634
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:31,080
around them just as the blood comes into the brain.

635
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:34,800
And if you turn on the brown fat, it warms the brain,

636
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:38,440
and the IQ of the swordfish goes way up.

637
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:44,200
And it swims faster and uses better evasive tactics.

638
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:48,240
And I'm trying to remember, there

639
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:49,640
are a couple of other animals that

640
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:52,720
are known to, cold-blooded animals, that

641
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:56,640
are known to have a warm-blooded brain that they can.

642
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:57,800
Isn't that a great feature?

643
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:03,480
I wonder, does our brain do a little bit of that?

644
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:11,080
Oh, I got lost telling funny stories.

645
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:19,400
So anyway, this K-line idea is very simple.

646
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:26,500
It says that perhaps the way human memory works

647
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:32,180
is that here and there, you have big collections of nerve

648
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:37,740
fibers that go somewhere and go to lots of cells.

649
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:40,480
Let's say thousands of these cells,

650
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:45,600
and each one is connected to some particular combination.

651
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:51,800
Imagine there's 100 wires here, and each of these cells

652
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:55,220
is connected to, say, 10 of those wires.

653
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:59,020
Then how many different cells could

654
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:01,580
you have for remembering different features

655
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:05,800
of what's on this big bus bar?

656
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:09,560
How many ways are there picking 10 things out of 100?

657
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:13,760
It's about 100 to the 10th power.

658
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:19,920
So here's a simple kind of memory where you have,

659
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:24,960
of course, it'd be useless unless these bits by themselves

660
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:28,720
have some correlation with some useful concept.

661
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:33,020
And then at any particular time on this particular bunch

662
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:39,220
of fibers in the brain, maybe 20 of these are turned on.

663
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:42,300
And if something very important has happened,

664
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:45,060
you send a signal to all these cells

665
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:51,780
and say any of you cells who are seeing more than 10 or 15

666
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:57,020
of these 20 fibers at this moment should remember that

667
00:50:57,020 --> 00:51:02,080
and set themselves to do something next time

668
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:05,720
you see that pattern, something like that.

669
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:07,880
Something has to decide which of these cells

670
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:11,880
is going to copy at this time and so forth.

671
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:17,240
So there's a theory of how memory, kind of symbolic memory,

672
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,280
might work in the brain.

673
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:21,580
And I got this idea from a paper.

674
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:24,320
I don't remember what their idea was,

675
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:29,940
but by David Waltz and Jordan Pollock.

676
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:35,740
Pollock is an AI theorist at Brandeis,

677
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:39,260
I guess, who in recent years has turned

678
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:42,200
into some kind of artist and makes

679
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:44,800
all sorts of beautiful things and simple robots

680
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,760
that do this and that.

681
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:51,540
David Waltz searched his web page

682
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:56,760
sometime because he was here for many years as a graduate

683
00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:01,640
student and then developed beautiful theories of vision.

684
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:03,040
When did Dave move?

685
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:06,000
Do you remember, Pat?

686
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,960
Anyway, something like that.

687
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:17,340
But as far as I know, so I made up

688
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:21,560
this theory, which is really copied from Waltz and Pollock,

689
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:29,080
but simplified and neatened up.

690
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:33,960
And that became, then I went on and made other theories

691
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:34,760
based on that.

692
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:38,240
But without them, I would have been

693
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:41,960
stuck in some conditioned reflex theory for a long time,

694
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:43,200
I suspect.

695
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,680
A minute.

696
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:45,160
Yeah.

697
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:48,700
You mentioned the role that the amygdala plays

698
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:53,100
in storing the short-term memory.

699
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:57,620
And you mentioned that the memories that are stored in there

700
00:52:57,620 --> 00:52:59,100
are wiped out.

701
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:01,100
Well, that's a question.

702
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:04,260
Presumably, as you grow up, your amygdala

703
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:08,900
gets better at learning what to recognize.

704
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:11,500
But I've never seen any discussion or theory

705
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:14,840
of how much of your short-term memory

706
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:18,920
is how do you learn and develop and get better

707
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:22,240
at remembering things that are worth remembering.

708
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,160
Sorry, go ahead.

709
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:26,000
My question is, I think, my understanding is that,

710
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:32,000
so whatever memories are stored in the amygdala during,

711
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:37,880
whatever stored in the amygdala is wiped out after you sleep.

712
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:39,420
What sort of implications does this

713
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:43,100
have about remembering dreams?

714
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:50,420
Because my understanding is that after you have a lucid dream,

715
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:53,580
you tend to forget the memories of the dream

716
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:57,100
are wiped out after a certain point later on in the day.

717
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:59,260
So what sort of implications does it

718
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:03,500
have on the ability of people to remember dreams that they have?

719
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:04,340
Good question.

720
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:10,740
There have been some theories, but I

721
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:14,380
think I mentioned Freud's theory, which is that you're not

722
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:15,740
remembering anything.

723
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:17,700
When you wake up, you make up the dream.

724
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:26,620
And I think that's surely completely wrong.

725
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:29,500
But Freud made it up because he was mad at Jung.

726
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:37,780
Jung had a theory that people have telepathic connections

727
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:39,440
with other people.

728
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:45,040
And so he had been Freud's student or disciple

729
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:46,640
for some years.

730
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:52,680
And then he went mystical, and Freud went up the wall

731
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:57,400
because Jung was obviously very smart and imaginative.

732
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:05,080
I'm trying to think of, I've had a very good student who

733
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:13,100
turned mystical, one or two, but not like that.

734
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:15,300
Anyway, that's a great question.

735
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:17,180
And when I said things hang around

736
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:23,660
in the amygdala for 20 minutes, that's just some things.

737
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:31,380
And clearly, they have to hang if it takes

738
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:37,760
sleep the next night, which is eight hours or 16 hours later

739
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:41,980
to solidify it or to copy it in some way

740
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:44,160
into the other parts of the brain.

741
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:47,220
It must still be in the amygdala or somewhere.

742
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:52,880
So in fact, maybe there's the amygdala

743
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:56,080
and some other parts of the brain

744
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:58,800
that haven't been identified that

745
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:03,840
contain slightly different copies of the memories

746
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:05,640
for a longer time and so forth.

747
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:10,440
So who knows where and how they work.

748
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:14,280
Maybe the language centers remember

749
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:19,400
paragraphs of things that you've heard or said for some time

750
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:20,800
and so forth.

751
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:26,360
I don't think anybody really knows much about,

752
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:29,200
they're very sure about the amygdala

753
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:35,520
because injuring the amygdala or injecting

754
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:39,160
novocaine into a blood vessel that goes there

755
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:41,640
has such a dramatic effect on.

756
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:44,760
You just can't remember anything for that short period

757
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:48,160
or half hour or so.

758
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:51,560
But there must be lots of other.

759
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:54,520
Maybe memories are stored in 10 different ways

760
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:56,480
in 10 different parts of the brain.

761
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:58,080
Who knows?

762
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:00,240
One problem that I think I mentioned

763
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:04,560
is that although a great deal has been learned about the brain

764
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:12,000
from modern scanning techniques, almost every result

765
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,800
that people talk about is obtained

766
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:19,200
by turning up the contrast so that most of the brain

767
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:24,340
is dark and nerve centers that are highly active

768
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:28,060
show up in your, you've all seen these pictures which

769
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:33,340
show three or four places in the brain lighting up.

770
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:37,940
Well, there's a good chance that for any particular event,

771
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:41,220
there might be 10 or 20 places that have just

772
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:42,340
increased a little bit.

773
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:45,820
And when they turn up the contrast,

774
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:50,500
all that evidence is lost because those regions all

775
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:53,780
become black or whatever.

776
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:56,340
Yeah, I'm not an expert on that, but I

777
00:57:56,340 --> 00:58:01,460
would go as far as to say that probably if they have a finding

778
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:05,300
that where there are no specific areas,

779
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:10,900
so you have a pretty uniform picture of the changes

780
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:14,900
in metabolism, then you don't make theories

781
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:18,220
or you don't publish that result because you don't have

782
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:20,460
any clear areas where to point that.

783
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:24,180
And then nobody knows that, OK, that particular thing

784
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:28,100
was actually exciting for all of the brains.

785
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:29,500
That's just a guess.

786
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:31,420
Yeah, could be that some things involve

787
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:33,700
very large amounts of brain.

788
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:38,140
But I'm inclined to doubt it.

789
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:39,940
Probably you want to turn a lot of things

790
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:42,860
off most of the time so they don't fill up

791
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:44,860
with random garbage.

792
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:46,380
Who knows?

793
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:47,460
Yes?

794
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:49,460
I just want to follow up on that.

795
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:53,340
Why do you think the hierarchy of goals is naive?

796
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:56,580
And what specific features of goals

797
00:58:56,580 --> 00:59:00,700
do you think that structure doesn't achieve?

798
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:02,180
I didn't finish that, did I?

799
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:14,940
She's asking.

800
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:17,540
I started to say, what's the hierarchy of goals?

801
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:21,740
But it looks like I got stuck on the well-defined instinctive

802
00:59:21,740 --> 00:59:24,300
goals that you need to stay alive.

803
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:29,420
And I guess my answer is I don't have any good theories

804
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:31,940
of how you do that.

805
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:36,740
At any time when you're talking to somebody,

806
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:39,900
you usually have a couple of very clear goals

807
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:46,980
like, I want to explain this, I want this other person

808
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:53,940
to understand this for this reason, I'm having trouble.

809
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:57,340
Maybe I have to get his or her attention.

810
00:59:57,340 --> 01:00:00,940
And then you get a subgoal of doing some social thing

811
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:05,620
to convince them to listen to you and all sorts of things.

812
01:00:05,620 --> 01:00:12,620
But I just don't have a nice picture.

813
01:00:12,620 --> 01:00:15,460
When you're writing an AI program,

814
01:00:15,460 --> 01:00:18,100
you usually have goals and subgoals

815
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:22,020
in a very clear arrangement.

816
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:25,540
Like the theorem proving programs

817
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:31,540
are wonderful because you've proved some kind of expression,

818
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:34,880
but the particular theorem you are trying to prove

819
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:39,200
has another condition which is different from this condition.

820
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:46,520
And people have gone quite far in making

821
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:53,160
models of something like theorem proving

822
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:56,080
where the world is very simple.

823
01:00:56,080 --> 01:01:00,120
If you're proving something in geometry or group theory

824
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:03,080
or a little fragment of mathematics,

825
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:07,000
then there are only five or 10 assumptions hanging around.

826
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:11,280
And so you could actually plan a little bit of exhaustive search

827
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:13,360
to go three or four levels.

828
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:17,240
And then you would do something like in a chess program

829
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:20,240
over time, discovering it never pays

830
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:27,560
to explore a tree that has this feature because of whatever.

831
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:28,640
Yes?

832
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:32,120
Are goals relevant?

833
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:36,480
Do we always have goals or is it just something related?

834
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:38,360
When I play chess, maybe I have a goal,

835
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:42,640
but why should I have a goal in life?

836
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:48,320
Why isn't that goal for a producer

837
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:51,560
created at some point of my life?

838
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:57,520
Why are goals important?

839
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:59,560
Well, the survival goals are important

840
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:04,720
because if you crossed a street without looking,

841
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:08,200
you could do that about 20 times before you're dead.

842
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:13,040
So why are there?

843
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:23,760
Well, if you don't make a living, you'll starve.

844
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:27,280
So now you have to, if you've committed yourself

845
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:29,640
to being a mathematician, now you

846
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:33,320
have to be a good mathematician or else you'll starve,

847
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:35,440
so forth.

848
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:37,800
I was a pretty good mathematician.

849
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:41,920
Only my goal is I had to be the best mathematician, so I quit.

850
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:50,280
You don't want to have a goal you can't achieve.

851
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:54,080
Yeah, but is that part of the intentions?

852
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:56,280
Well, a lot of people do have ones,

853
01:02:56,280 --> 01:03:01,920
so it eats up a lot of their time, and they're wasting it.

854
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:04,080
I'm not sure what the question is.

855
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:06,760
How do you make a?

856
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:10,000
I think the feature of humans is that there's

857
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,280
sort of general purpose.

858
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:18,280
So there are a lot of things people do which are bad things

859
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:22,640
to do, and you can't justify them.

860
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:26,200
You could think of people as part of a huge search process,

861
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:31,880
and as a species or a genetic system,

862
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:35,240
it pays to have a few crazy ones every now and then

863
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:38,200
because if the environment suddenly changes,

864
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:40,000
maybe they'll be the only ones who survive.

865
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:45,960
William Calvin's question, how come people

866
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:51,120
evolved intelligence so rapidly in 5 million years?

867
01:03:51,120 --> 01:04:00,680
And he attributes it partly to 10, 5,

868
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:04,280
how many periods of global cooling were there?

869
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:09,480
It's about six or seven ice ages in the last.

870
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:11,160
Anybody know the history of the Earth?

871
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:17,180
Anyway, some evidence, at least used to be,

872
01:04:17,180 --> 01:04:21,080
I haven't paid any attention, is that the human population

873
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:24,640
has got down to maybe just tens of thousands

874
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:27,840
several times in the last million years.

875
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:33,520
And so only the really different ones managed to pull through.

876
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:38,960
Might be the ones who had all sorts of useless abilities.

877
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:40,040
Yes?

878
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:41,840
So you were talking about learning others.

879
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:44,960
The ones who ate the others, which would have

880
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:47,040
been punished before that.

881
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:47,680
Go ahead.

882
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:49,200
You were talking about representing

883
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:53,360
like the K lines and everything, like having some lines

884
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:55,360
and then activating some of these features.

885
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:58,120
So in the case of learning, would we

886
01:04:58,120 --> 01:04:59,840
change some of these connections?

887
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:02,640
And if this is the case, how will this

888
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:07,320
affect the higher order, higher objects like frames

889
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:08,160
and everything?

890
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:09,560
Like if we change something that's

891
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:12,320
really the low level representation,

892
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:15,160
will this affect a lot, wouldn't the whole system

893
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:17,720
break because some subprocedure wouldn't

894
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:20,000
Oh, that's great.

895
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,720
That's another question I can't begin to answer.

896
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:28,600
Namely, when you learn something,

897
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:30,080
let's take the extreme form.

898
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:32,600
Do you start a new representation

899
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:35,440
or you modify an old one?

900
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:37,400
OK, that's a choice.

901
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:40,240
If you modify an old one, can you

902
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:44,240
do that without losing the previous version?

903
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:51,240
So for example, if I grow up monolingually, which I did,

904
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:57,480
so I learned English, and then I can't remember why,

905
01:05:57,480 --> 01:06:03,920
but for some reason around fourth grade,

906
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:07,320
some teacher tried to teach us German.

907
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:13,480
And so for each German word, I tried very hard

908
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:16,200
to find the equivalent English word

909
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:20,720
and figure out how to move your mouth so that it comes out

910
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:25,000
German, which actually, for many words,

911
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:29,000
works fine because English is a mixture of German

912
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,840
and other things.

913
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:32,840
And for many words, it doesn't.

914
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:35,200
So that was a bad idea.

915
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:38,140
And if I had gotten very good at it,

916
01:06:38,140 --> 01:06:41,720
I could have lost some English.

917
01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:46,320
Anyway, that's a great set of questions.

918
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:48,360
When do you make new memories?

919
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:50,640
When do you modify old ones?

920
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:57,120
And the hard one is, if you can't modify an old one,

921
01:06:57,120 --> 01:07:02,600
how do you make a copy that's different?

922
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:07,480
And there's a section called In Society of Mind

923
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:13,000
about how we do that in language by paraphrasing

924
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,960
what someone said.

925
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:21,480
Or you say something in your own head, and you misunderstand it.

926
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:22,800
I'm doing that all the time.

927
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:25,760
I say, such and such is this or that.

928
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:28,640
And then it's as though somebody else had said that,

929
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:31,480
and I have somebody say, no, that's wrong.

930
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:33,800
He meant this.

931
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:37,400
So when you're talking to yourself,

932
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:44,520
you're actually converting some mysterious inarticulate

933
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:47,120
representation to speech.

934
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:49,880
And then you're running it through your brain

935
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:52,880
and listening to it and converting the speech back

936
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:55,000
to a new representation.

937
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:58,020
So I think the wonderful thing about language

938
01:07:58,020 --> 01:08:01,040
is it's not just for expressing.

939
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:07,120
It may be, how come the only animal that

940
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:12,000
thinks the way we do is the only animal that talks the way we

941
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,840
do?

942
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:14,880
Who knows?

943
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:19,440
Maybe whales, but nobody has decoded them,

944
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:22,520
do something like that.

945
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:23,720
But that's a question.

946
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:27,720
How do you copy a memory to make a new version?

947
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:32,480
And the answer is, you can ask anyone, and they'll say,

948
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:34,240
I don't know.

949
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:36,520
Why aren't there five theories of that?

950
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:39,440
Yeah.

951
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:40,880
I don't know if that's true, but I

952
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:43,680
believe there is kind of a sort of objective map

953
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:46,720
between words in language, like, for example,

954
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:47,360
non-nouns.

955
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:52,040
So for example, if I have a table,

956
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:55,840
I say like mesa in Portuguese.

957
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:59,480
There's sort of an objective map, even for colors,

958
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:05,840
which is sort of weird, because you're kind of dividing

959
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:09,000
all the colors into chunks of colors.

960
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:16,480
And even, I believe, for words, language that were not formed

961
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:18,960
with the same ancestry, I don't know.

962
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:22,320
For me, it seems that there's some sort of objective map

963
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:24,440
between words.

964
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:27,640
There are certain things that are just sort of naturally

965
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:30,520
more useful to talk about, and so a lot of languages

966
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:32,480
tend to have the words for the same thing,

967
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:35,680
like languages will have a word, and then it's a table.

968
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:38,040
But if there's some kind of path table,

969
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:40,920
something wrong with a path, and you say the word for table.

970
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:43,240
And regarding the colors thing, there have actually

971
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:45,480
been some interesting studies done on that.

972
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:48,360
They've done color survey, color naming survey,

973
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:49,920
with lots of languages in the world.

974
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:53,640
And it turns out that different languages,

975
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:55,680
partition the color space differently.

976
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:58,320
I was just going to ask if anybody knows.

977
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:01,120
They tend to do it similarly in the way

978
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:02,960
that people perceive colors.

979
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:05,720
The way that they divide up the space based on the number of words

980
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:08,080
that they have is actually like maximizing

981
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:11,080
the similarity of things with the same name

982
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:14,520
and the difference between things.

983
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:15,020
Yes.

984
01:10:15,020 --> 01:10:19,240
But Dara Kowalczynski did some interesting studies on that.

985
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:21,600
I'm trying to remember when children use colors.

986
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:26,560
Let's see.

987
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:31,560
I had a daughter who have still, I might say.

988
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:38,400
And she suddenly started color words

989
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:43,160
and had six or seven of them in just a couple of days.

990
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:46,240
And she sort of got interested in that.

991
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:49,480
And so suddenly, I said, oh my gosh,

992
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:54,680
this is what Maria Montessori calls a,

993
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:56,200
I forget what she called it.

994
01:10:56,200 --> 01:11:01,200
What's this moment when the child is open to being taught?

995
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:05,360
So I said, this is her chance to learn a lot of new color names.

996
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:08,360
So I said, and what about this?

997
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:11,120
I said, that's aqua.

998
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:13,160
And she said, that's blue green.

999
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:19,360
And I said, no, this is aqua.

1000
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:20,440
And she refused.

1001
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:26,960
So that was that.

1002
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:30,080
So some months later, she learned some more color names,

1003
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:32,800
but it wasn't the same.

1004
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:35,200
When she was saying blue green, was that because somebody

1005
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:37,240
had taught her blue green, or it was because she

1006
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:38,480
was combining it through color?

1007
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:40,000
I think she was combining it.

1008
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:40,720
Do you remember?

1009
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:42,440
Yeah, I think she was combining it.

1010
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:45,600
She was combining blue and blue green.

1011
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:48,880
So she had a concept that there were certain building

1012
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:49,840
blocks of colors.

1013
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:54,640
It looked like she wouldn't accept a new one.

1014
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:59,840
And I always wondered if I was 15 minutes too late.

1015
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:01,960
When does the Montessori door shut?

1016
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:07,800
Sort of similarly, there are studies

1017
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:09,400
done on different light-division points

1018
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:11,680
on how well people distinguish different colors.

1019
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:14,320
So in Russian, there's a different word

1020
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:16,480
that means light blue and dark blue.

1021
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:18,240
So Russians are better at distinguishing

1022
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:21,080
different shades of blue than, say, Americans.

1023
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:22,760
And there's also a lot of languages

1024
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:25,480
that don't have distinct words for blue and green.

1025
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:27,840
And native speakers of those languages

1026
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:29,600
have trouble distinguishing blue and green.

1027
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:30,960
That gives me a great idea.

1028
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:37,440
If I could have found some unfamiliar objects

1029
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:41,000
and colored them aqua, that might have fooled her.

1030
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:45,080
There must be.

1031
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:52,320
Is there a branch of psychology that worries about?

1032
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:57,440
Because there must be names for sounds too.

1033
01:12:57,440 --> 01:13:03,880
And certainly, a lot's known about ages at which children

1034
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:07,320
can't get new phonemes.

1035
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:07,840
Yes?

1036
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:12,000
Yeah, about storing memory and language.

1037
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,000
So I'm bilingual.

1038
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,520
Maybe other bilingual people in the audience

1039
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:16,280
could confirm this.

1040
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:17,680
I didn't know that.

1041
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:18,760
What's your other language?

1042
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:19,480
French.

1043
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:20,240
For heaven's sake.

1044
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:25,360
I've known Henry for 20-odd years.

1045
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:30,800
So one thing that can happen is you

1046
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:35,200
can be talking with another bilingual person.

1047
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:37,160
So I can be talking with someone who also both

1048
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:38,680
speaks French and English.

1049
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:41,440
And then a week later, I'll remember every detail

1050
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:43,680
about a complicated conversation.

1051
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:45,680
We were working on this project, and we needed this,

1052
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:46,480
and all this stuff.

1053
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:49,280
I remember every detail except which language

1054
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:52,480
we had the conversation.

1055
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:55,040
My entire family is like, oh, we generally

1056
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:57,400
speak a mix of Russian and English all the time.

1057
01:13:57,400 --> 01:14:01,080
So I can never remember even what language

1058
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:04,040
I'm speaking at the time.

1059
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:05,280
Yeah, that missupplies me.

1060
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:07,000
Because if we started in a language,

1061
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:10,360
how could I forget what language we used?

1062
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:13,240
Well, I think there is a very simple answer to that one.

1063
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:18,200
You have a language that's neither English or French,

1064
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:24,000
and you just have a very simple tag going there.

1065
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,960
And then you just, whenever you want

1066
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:30,000
to express something in English or French,

1067
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,960
you just encode, decode, encode whatever

1068
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:37,600
is the word, those thoughts that you were having.

1069
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:38,600
Well, that's the question.

1070
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:41,000
Why is that a language, or do you have any thoughts on that?

1071
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,240
I don't know.

1072
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:44,080
It reminds me, I think I mentioned this,

1073
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:50,400
but I was once at a meeting in Yerevan, Armenia,

1074
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:58,160
and there was a translator who was practically real time.

1075
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:03,880
And Francis Crick was talking, and at some point,

1076
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:08,080
the translator switched, and he started

1077
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:11,480
translating from English to English.

1078
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:16,080
So Crick would say something, and the translator

1079
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:20,720
would translate it into English very well, I thought.

1080
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:23,840
It wasn't quite the same words.

1081
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:27,680
And after a while, somebody asked him

1082
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:31,120
why he was doing that, and he said

1083
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:35,080
he didn't realize he had switched.

1084
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:37,600
Do you think that could happen to you?

1085
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:40,600
I suppose.

1086
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:41,080
Yeah.

1087
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:44,400
Do you think that there are other ways of transmitting ideas

1088
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:47,480
and learning, maybe like arts or music, besides language

1089
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:49,240
that can be really helpful?

1090
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:55,440
I don't think there's anything nearly like language,

1091
01:15:55,440 --> 01:16:01,960
but art is pretty good, but it's so ambiguous.

1092
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:05,280
Cartoons, they're awfully good.

1093
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:07,320
How about plays?

1094
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:09,320
What?

1095
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:10,760
How about lisp?

1096
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:12,280
Lisp.

1097
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:13,240
All right.

1098
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:14,440
Programming languages.

1099
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:20,160
Yes, why is mathematics so hard?

1100
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:26,120
I wonder if the habit of using a single letter for every

1101
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:33,080
variable might make it easy and hard.

1102
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:33,600
Who knows?

1103
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:38,660
Yes?

1104
01:16:38,660 --> 01:16:40,160
You have great questions.

1105
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:44,160
Last year, you mentioned that mathematics is hard.

1106
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:46,160
I thought about it.

1107
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:47,160
Say it again.

1108
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:51,160
Last year, you mentioned that mathematics is hard.

1109
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:55,160
And I thought about it, and I do feel

1110
01:16:55,160 --> 01:17:01,160
like there's an extreme lack of representations of ideas.

1111
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:06,160
Solving a problem, we need to identify so many things.

1112
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:13,000
And there's so many processes that you apply to them

1113
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:19,000
without having a name for any of them for classification.

1114
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Well, you have induction and deduction.

1115
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:25,400
That's about it, and contradiction.

1116
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:30,800
Yes, and you have this one feature of mathematics

1117
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:35,480
is completely un-redundant representations.

1118
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:39,160
I wonder if there's some way to fix that or change it.

1119
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:48,680
What other activity do we have where there's absolutely

1120
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:54,080
no redundancy at all in a mathematical experience?

1121
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:56,000
So for some people, it's delightful,

1122
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:00,680
and other people, it's very hard.

1123
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:04,280
I mentioned Licklider, who in programming,

1124
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:09,120
he would have very long, variable names.

1125
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:11,360
Sometimes they'd even be sentences,

1126
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:16,280
like the register in which I put the result of.

1127
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:21,240
And the great thing was you could read those programs.

1128
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:26,920
They looked sort of stupid, but he didn't have to make it.

1129
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:27,960
He didn't have to add.

1130
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:29,640
What do you call notes?

1131
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:32,040
He didn't have to have exclamation point.

1132
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:34,280
This means that.

1133
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:35,360
Comments, comments.

1134
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:44,240
When I sit in algebraic topology class,

1135
01:18:44,240 --> 01:18:47,040
I just can't make myself accept the concepts

1136
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:49,440
unless I can understand it algebraically

1137
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:52,760
and in a geometric condition.

1138
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:54,600
What kind of math do you like?

1139
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:55,760
Do you do topology?

1140
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:59,240
I like topology.

1141
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:00,960
I love topology.

1142
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:05,160
It was I once was tutoring a high school

1143
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:10,760
student who couldn't do algebra.

1144
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:12,560
I don't know if I mentioned this.

1145
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:15,480
And it turned out he didn't know how to use parentheses.

1146
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:29,520
So he would have an expression, stuff like that.

1147
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:47,000
And but if there were something in there,

1148
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:52,840
he didn't know what that meant because he knew sometimes

1149
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:58,280
he would he didn't know how to match them.

1150
01:19:58,280 --> 01:20:01,440
So I couldn't figure out why.

1151
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:02,720
And I asked, how come?

1152
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:04,960
And he said, maybe I was sick the day

1153
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:07,400
they explained parentheses.

1154
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:11,080
And so I gave him little exercises

1155
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:13,760
like make them into eggs.

1156
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:16,440
And you see, if you make this into an egg,

1157
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:17,880
then this egg won't work.

1158
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:26,600
And the funny thing was he got that in five minutes.

1159
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:31,720
And then he didn't have any trouble with algebra the rest.

1160
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:33,000
Can you imagine?

1161
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:33,920
I wonder.

1162
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:35,520
I've never done much tutoring.

1163
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:41,320
But if you can find the bug like that, it must be great fun.

1164
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:46,480
But I bet it doesn't happen very often.

1165
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:47,280
That was so funny.

1166
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:50,280
I couldn't imagine not, you know.

1167
01:20:57,520 --> 01:21:01,680
So if you don't have language, there must be.

1168
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:08,880
Well, why are some people so much better at math than others?

1169
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:12,360
So it's just that they've not understood about five things.

1170
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:18,680
I feel like they have a set of things

1171
01:21:18,680 --> 01:21:22,400
they know to go to when they face a problem.

1172
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:28,840
Well, that's kind of similar to your Bayman story.

1173
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:32,360
But I feel like they know exactly.

1174
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:37,440
They have names for concepts of ways of solving problems.

1175
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:38,520
So they look at a problem.

1176
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:40,600
They're like, I'm going to try this approach.

1177
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:44,400
And then if it doesn't work, I know this other approach.

1178
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:45,640
I'll just try it.

1179
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:49,360
Instead of looking at the problem and you think, OK,

1180
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:54,720
so what possible thing, what possible method can I think of?

1181
01:21:54,720 --> 01:21:57,320
Oh, names for methods.

1182
01:21:57,320 --> 01:22:01,160
So do you have public names or are they secret names?

1183
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:02,960
I feel like they're secret names.

1184
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:04,240
They're just like the store.

1185
01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:07,200
Because they can't explain it to other people.

1186
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:09,800
They can't be like, this problem, like, very few of them

1187
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:12,280
can do this problem and that problem.

1188
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:15,400
They generally have the general same method,

1189
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:18,680
although they're very different.

1190
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:22,120
I had a friend who was a composer.

1191
01:22:22,120 --> 01:22:24,880
And she had all sorts of sounds.

1192
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:27,440
And they were filed away on tapes.

1193
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:31,560
And the tapes had little symbols on them.

1194
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:36,400
And if she needed a sound, she would go to the closet

1195
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:38,280
and pull out the right tape.

1196
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:41,360
And it had more symbols written on the reel.

1197
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:45,920
And she'd get this thing, which might be a thunderstorm

1198
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:50,800
or a bird or something.

1199
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:55,800
So I asked her what was her notation for these sounds.

1200
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:59,480
And she giggled and said, I can't tell you.

1201
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:02,080
It's too embarrassing.

1202
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:04,640
I never found out.

1203
01:23:04,640 --> 01:23:08,160
But she had developed some code for sounds.

1204
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:08,680
Yeah.

1205
01:23:08,840 --> 01:23:13,320
So I would say that they have somewhat more representation

1206
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:20,440
of things that math requires than all symbols or patterns

1207
01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:22,240
of solutions.

1208
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:25,880
And their representation is optimal.

1209
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:27,560
And if you're good at math, it doesn't

1210
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:29,880
mean that you're good at playing music.

1211
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:32,960
Because when you play music well,

1212
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:36,760
you have maybe a good representation of the sounds.

1213
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:43,240
And so it's just being optimal and representative of things.

1214
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:44,240
I agree.

1215
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:51,120
And so you can access, like, oh, so I

1216
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:53,760
have these solutions, these patterns of solutions

1217
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:59,520
that I need to solve this math problem.

1218
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:02,680
I have, I don't know, by induction or by contradiction.

1219
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:07,840
And in his brain or somebody that knows a lot,

1220
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:10,880
the person can access very fast.

1221
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:13,800
The representation itself is very well-defined.

1222
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:19,880
So you can access.

1223
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:21,880
That's an interesting whole.

1224
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:27,960
Remember, let me interrupt.

1225
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:31,840
I was once in some class.

1226
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:35,920
And math class.

1227
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:40,680
And it was about n-dimensional vector spaces.

1228
01:24:40,680 --> 01:24:49,920
And some student asked, well, how do you

1229
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:53,560
imagine an n-dimensional vector space?

1230
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:56,600
And there's two stories.

1231
01:24:56,600 --> 01:25:00,000
And the instructor, who I forget who,

1232
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:05,480
thought for a while, and then he said, oh, it's very simple.

1233
01:25:05,480 --> 01:25:09,400
Just pick a particular n.

1234
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:12,280
So that was completely useless.

1235
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:21,120
So then next time, and I was a disciple

1236
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:25,200
of a mathematician at Harvard named Andrew Gleason, who

1237
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:32,040
was a wonderful man, only a couple of years older than me.

1238
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:38,760
But he had won the Putnam three times, first prize.

1239
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:44,680
And I said, what would you tell a student who

1240
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:47,840
wanted to understand an n-dimensional vector space,

1241
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:49,800
what it means?

1242
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:54,000
And he said, well, you should give him five or six ways.

1243
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:08,640
I don't know.

1244
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:09,920
Imagine a bunch of arrows.

1245
01:26:14,160 --> 01:26:16,600
And remember that each of them is at right angles

1246
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:20,120
to all the others, just like that.

1247
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:26,960
And then he added, and you should make the sum.

1248
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:28,400
And if there's an infinite number,

1249
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:31,080
you should have the sum of the squares of their lengths

1250
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:34,280
converge to a finite value.

1251
01:26:34,280 --> 01:26:36,960
And then he said, or you should think of it

1252
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:45,240
as a Fourier series with things of different frequencies.

1253
01:26:45,240 --> 01:26:48,600
And then he said, or you should think

1254
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:55,400
of an object in a topological space,

1255
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:59,760
and each dimension is finding the boundary of the last one.

1256
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:03,560
And he went on for about six or seven.

1257
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:06,240
And that was a great idea.

1258
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:12,040
That is, well, have seven completely different ways.

1259
01:27:12,040 --> 01:27:16,040
And I remember I once had the same conversation

1260
01:27:16,040 --> 01:27:17,960
with Richard Feynman.

1261
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:19,640
And I said, well, how did you do that?

1262
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:24,560
And he said, well, when I grew up, I always, whatever it was,

1263
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:27,520
I always thought of three or four representations.

1264
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:30,920
So if one of them didn't work, another one would.

1265
01:27:30,920 --> 01:27:31,420
What?

1266
01:27:31,420 --> 01:27:34,560
Yeah, so my idea for somebody who wanted to,

1267
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:37,680
if you asked them about how to understand

1268
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:41,800
what the dimension of space is, is say, read flat land.

1269
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:43,960
Read flat land.

1270
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:46,440
Because that would give you the analogy.

1271
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:48,200
Once you have that analogy, then you

1272
01:27:48,200 --> 01:27:51,440
could, it would be easy to extend it to other dimensions.

1273
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:51,960
Oh, good.

1274
01:27:51,960 --> 01:27:54,520
Has anybody written a 4D flat land

1275
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:58,560
where you make fun of the 3D people who, they

1276
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:00,400
can't get out of a paper bag?

1277
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:00,880
Yeah.

1278
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:01,380
No.

1279
01:28:01,380 --> 01:28:07,560
And so there will be some events that maybe will prove that.

1280
01:28:07,560 --> 01:28:11,880
So for example, in my case, when I do a lot of math,

1281
01:28:11,880 --> 01:28:15,880
when I try to talk to people, it's very hard.

1282
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:20,760
And maybe I'm open to seeing my representation of solving

1283
01:28:20,760 --> 01:28:22,240
problems in math.

1284
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:27,400
And maybe I'm open to seeing my representation of solving

1285
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:28,920
problems in math.

1286
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:33,720
And people tend to get better in math

1287
01:28:33,720 --> 01:28:36,840
if they practice a lot because they are optimizing

1288
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:38,000
representation in math.

1289
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:41,880
And that would be the case.

1290
01:28:41,880 --> 01:28:44,200
That's it.

1291
01:28:44,200 --> 01:28:48,600
I think I understand the problem.

1292
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:50,640
But I don't think I have any friends left

1293
01:28:50,640 --> 01:28:52,360
who are not mathematicians.

1294
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:59,240
That's what happens if you live in this place long enough.

1295
01:29:02,440 --> 01:29:03,120
Yeah.

1296
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:06,000
I feel like, so that's one way they're doing better.

1297
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
I feel like the other way they're doing better

1298
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:13,600
is they objectify things that we don't objectify.

1299
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:19,760
Like, it's like the learning how to learn better idea.

1300
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:25,840
Learning how to learn better to learn better.

1301
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:31,440
So it's one thing to know what the right representation is

1302
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:34,040
for predicting the problem or the right method is.

1303
01:29:34,040 --> 01:29:36,920
It's another thing to optimize that process.

1304
01:29:36,920 --> 01:29:42,600
So what process did I use in finding that representation?

1305
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:45,240
And then they make that into a concept.

1306
01:29:45,240 --> 01:29:49,400
And then they have a lot of these concepts.

1307
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:52,160
Have you ever helped somebody to learn better?

1308
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,320
Yeah.

1309
01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:00,440
What did you tell them?

1310
01:30:00,440 --> 01:30:09,240
So she had trouble with basically true truth tables,

1311
01:30:09,240 --> 01:30:14,120
something like that, and or, and stuff like that.

1312
01:30:14,120 --> 01:30:18,960
So her way of seeing the problem is to make a chart.

1313
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:23,360
I forgot what I told her.

1314
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:29,280
I told her to kind of map simple problems.

1315
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:36,840
You know, maybe most people don't have the word

1316
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:42,280
representation in their language.

1317
01:30:42,280 --> 01:30:45,080
Is there any place in grade school

1318
01:30:45,080 --> 01:30:49,360
where you actually talk about, what's

1319
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:52,400
your representation of acceleration?

1320
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:58,480
Do we teach that word as part of any subject?

1321
01:30:58,480 --> 01:31:06,320
Parts, if you're drawing some base or something like that,

1322
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:09,520
they'll ask you to represent it.

1323
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:10,120
Yes.

1324
01:31:15,160 --> 01:31:18,760
It's, but it's hard to get out of.

1325
01:31:18,760 --> 01:31:20,160
Yeah, OK.

1326
01:31:20,160 --> 01:31:26,000
So they're radically different representations of.

1327
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,640
Maybe that's going more far than school.

1328
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:30,720
Yes, I don't know.

1329
01:31:30,720 --> 01:31:33,200
Did you have an idea that something maybe

1330
01:31:33,200 --> 01:31:37,200
did to correct your picture?

1331
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:39,320
Tinker toys.

1332
01:31:39,320 --> 01:31:41,720
Tinker toy.

1333
01:31:41,720 --> 01:31:45,440
Yes, that's to represent physical structures

1334
01:31:45,440 --> 01:31:46,400
as tinker toys.

1335
01:31:49,720 --> 01:31:53,440
Yeah, I wrote a little article complaining

1336
01:31:53,440 --> 01:32:01,880
about the popularity of LEGO as opposed to tinker toy,

1337
01:32:01,880 --> 01:32:05,720
because the children who grow up with LEGO

1338
01:32:05,720 --> 01:32:08,880
can't understand how to make something strong

1339
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:09,880
by making a triangle.

1340
01:32:12,720 --> 01:32:19,440
So I sort of had the conjecture that although those people

1341
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:23,040
could build all sorts of wonderful houses and things,

1342
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:29,160
they ended up deficient in having

1343
01:32:29,160 --> 01:32:34,000
the most important of all architectural concepts.

1344
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:37,840
The triangle is infinitely strong,

1345
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:42,800
because, I mean, you can't alter a triangle

1346
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:51,120
without breaking it, whereas I don't know what.

1347
01:32:51,120 --> 01:32:53,240
That's a run on sentence I can't finish.

1348
01:32:56,120 --> 01:32:58,680
This explains the deterioration of society, Barbara.

1349
01:32:58,680 --> 01:33:03,600
We don't have tinker toys, and we don't have chemistry sets

1350
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:07,960
of chemicals that make explosives anymore.

1351
01:33:07,960 --> 01:33:12,400
You have to go to terrorist school to get a good education.

1352
01:33:15,880 --> 01:33:18,400
So actually, in this conversation

1353
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:22,000
about being good at things and learning how to learn better,

1354
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,560
I think that a point that sort of relates

1355
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:28,360
to this idea of tinker sets and playing around with things,

1356
01:33:28,360 --> 01:33:30,640
I think that it's not enough to simply come up

1357
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:34,720
with the best representations of a concept.

1358
01:33:34,720 --> 01:33:36,680
In order to actually be good at something,

1359
01:33:36,680 --> 01:33:39,760
whether it's music or speaking a new language,

1360
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:42,080
you have to not only understand it conceptually,

1361
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:45,840
but you actually have to gain a certain amount of fluency.

1362
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:48,600
And to gain fluency, you do have to play around

1363
01:33:48,600 --> 01:33:50,880
with the thing a lot, whether it's

1364
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:54,680
turning it around in your mind or practicing it physically.

1365
01:33:54,680 --> 01:33:56,520
So in the case of math, it's like, yeah, you

1366
01:33:56,520 --> 01:33:58,840
can come up with all these different representations

1367
01:33:58,840 --> 01:34:02,280
of it, and that's the first step in understanding it.

1368
01:34:02,280 --> 01:34:03,880
It's great once you understand it,

1369
01:34:03,880 --> 01:34:07,160
but just because you understand the concept

1370
01:34:07,160 --> 01:34:08,680
on a conceptual level doesn't mean

1371
01:34:08,680 --> 01:34:13,400
that you can actually know when to use it

1372
01:34:13,400 --> 01:34:16,640
or know how to use it when you're solving a problem.

1373
01:34:16,640 --> 01:34:20,560
And similarly for music, I guess I'm

1374
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:22,920
mostly talking in the case of improvisational music

1375
01:34:22,920 --> 01:34:25,120
when I'm trying to speak something with the music.

1376
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:27,040
So I have something that I want to say,

1377
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:29,880
and maybe it's something that's sort of low level.

1378
01:34:29,880 --> 01:34:34,720
I'm trying to resolve one chord to get to some sort of cadence.

1379
01:34:34,720 --> 01:34:37,880
Now, I can have multiple ways of resolving the chord,

1380
01:34:37,880 --> 01:34:40,680
and in order to do this, I have a vocabulary

1381
01:34:40,680 --> 01:34:41,640
of the different ways.

1382
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:45,160
And if one way doesn't occur to me when I'm playing the piece,

1383
01:34:45,160 --> 01:34:46,320
I can try another way.

1384
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:48,560
But the important thing is that I have some way

1385
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:50,760
that I can resolve it in real time,

1386
01:34:50,760 --> 01:34:53,440
or else my piece is never going to come out.

1387
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:55,840
And then the same thing about learning different languages

1388
01:34:55,840 --> 01:34:57,280
or speaking different languages.

1389
01:34:57,280 --> 01:35:00,880
In order to be able to speak or to express ourselves,

1390
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:03,440
we have to have not only understanding

1391
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:04,840
of the language, of the structure,

1392
01:35:04,840 --> 01:35:07,800
but the immediacy of being able to access it.

1393
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:13,920
And that comes with practice, with tinkering, whatever you.

1394
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:20,280
Well, maybe that goes in several directions.

1395
01:35:20,280 --> 01:35:24,520
One thing about where in our educational system

1396
01:35:24,520 --> 01:35:29,920
do we, in grade school, is there a place

1397
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:34,880
where you emphasize having several representations?

1398
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:37,360
Because I can't think clearly right now,

1399
01:35:37,360 --> 01:35:40,400
but it seems to me that you're usually trying to tell them

1400
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:41,600
the one best way.

1401
01:35:46,240 --> 01:35:49,200
AUDIENCE MEMBER 2 A, there's the idea of the one best way.

1402
01:35:49,200 --> 01:35:53,240
And B, there's the idea of reinforcing

1403
01:35:53,240 --> 01:35:55,080
the same process over and over again.

1404
01:35:55,080 --> 01:35:57,600
So when you learn math, it's like you learn this technique,

1405
01:35:57,600 --> 01:36:00,600
and you reinforce the technique by doing a bunch of homework

1406
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:03,840
problems that are essentially repetitions of the same thing.

1407
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:05,800
Whereas I think a better way of doing it, well,

1408
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:06,720
two better ways.

1409
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:08,640
A, you have multiple representations.

1410
01:36:08,640 --> 01:36:10,880
And two, you create problems where

1411
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:14,200
you make people traverse paths differently.

1412
01:36:14,200 --> 01:36:16,120
And different people may have different solutions.

1413
01:36:16,120 --> 01:36:17,920
And each time you solve the problem,

1414
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:19,640
you may have a different solution.

1415
01:36:19,640 --> 01:36:23,600
But the idea is you lay out a whole network of paths

1416
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:26,000
in your head to solve any given type of problem.

1417
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:27,520
MARVIN MINSKY So where in grade school

1418
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:32,040
do you ask children to solve the same problem three ways?

1419
01:36:32,040 --> 01:36:34,720
Can anybody think of?

1420
01:36:34,720 --> 01:36:37,600
Is that part of education?

1421
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:38,120
What?

1422
01:36:38,120 --> 01:36:39,800
AUDIENCE MEMBER 2 Closest thing I can come up with.

1423
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:42,760
MARVIN MINSKY With fractions?

1424
01:36:42,760 --> 01:36:44,840
What about literature class?

1425
01:36:44,840 --> 01:36:46,520
They ask you for integrations of novels.

1426
01:36:46,520 --> 01:36:49,320
MARVIN MINSKY Yes.

1427
01:36:49,320 --> 01:36:51,680
Yes, I bet there are things that happen in literature

1428
01:36:51,680 --> 01:36:55,240
that don't happen anywhere else in the curriculum.

1429
01:36:55,240 --> 01:36:58,480
But they probably don't have, most children

1430
01:36:58,480 --> 01:37:01,280
don't transfer it.

1431
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:05,320
AUDIENCE MEMBER 3 When I was in China and learning math,

1432
01:37:05,320 --> 01:37:09,560
when we try to find areas of certain geometric shapes,

1433
01:37:09,560 --> 01:37:13,840
we always do it in multiple ways.

1434
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:16,000
MARVIN MINSKY In topology, whatever it is,

1435
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:21,200
you just make it into triangles or simplexes.

1436
01:37:21,200 --> 01:37:23,120
It's a very strange subject.

1437
01:37:25,120 --> 01:37:27,040
AUDIENCE MEMBER 4 Maybe one of the reasons why topology is

1438
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:30,040
so nice is because you can think about it

1439
01:37:30,040 --> 01:37:37,400
as logical, cosets, you count all the different points,

1440
01:37:37,400 --> 01:37:39,400
stuff like that.

1441
01:37:39,400 --> 01:37:43,360
And then you can imagine it as a picture.

1442
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:45,440
Cosets.

1443
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:48,720
Where in real life do you have duality?

1444
01:37:48,720 --> 01:37:53,240
That's a nice feature of a lot of mathematics.

1445
01:37:53,240 --> 01:37:54,960
Whatever you're doing in some fields,

1446
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:57,680
there's a dual way where you look

1447
01:37:57,680 --> 01:38:00,960
at the space of the functions on the objects

1448
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:03,200
rather than the objects.

1449
01:38:03,200 --> 01:38:08,440
I can't think of an, where is that in loop?

1450
01:38:08,440 --> 01:38:10,160
Is there anything like that in real life?

1451
01:38:14,320 --> 01:38:17,080
Because in mathematics, a lot of problems

1452
01:38:17,080 --> 01:38:19,880
suddenly become much easier in their dual form.

1453
01:38:22,440 --> 01:38:23,680
You just change everything.

1454
01:38:31,160 --> 01:38:33,200
I've been facing one way.

1455
01:38:36,200 --> 01:38:38,840
AUDIENCE MEMBER 5 I guess a couple of points.

1456
01:38:38,840 --> 01:38:41,800
You said why is it difficult?

1457
01:38:41,800 --> 01:38:46,080
Whenever I struggle, I think it's because it's constructive.

1458
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:48,680
And you have to hold a lot in your head.

1459
01:38:48,680 --> 01:38:52,280
You hold the entire structure of almost a field.

1460
01:38:52,280 --> 01:38:54,520
Because if you're learning algebraic topology,

1461
01:38:54,520 --> 01:38:56,880
you're holding all of algebra and all

1462
01:38:56,880 --> 01:38:58,200
of that structure in your head.

1463
01:38:58,200 --> 01:38:59,760
So sometimes it becomes difficult

1464
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:02,560
if you haven't abstracted it to the right level.

1465
01:39:02,560 --> 01:39:05,600
And what I found, I think, my advisor was just really good

1466
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:06,520
many times.

1467
01:39:06,520 --> 01:39:07,920
And basically, he said two things.

1468
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:10,240
Just really good mathematicians are really

1469
01:39:10,240 --> 01:39:13,400
good at making analogies in mathematics.

1470
01:39:13,400 --> 01:39:16,080
And I was studying algebraic geometry.

1471
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:18,440
And he says, and really good algebraic geometers

1472
01:39:18,440 --> 01:39:21,040
can boil everything down to linear algebra.

1473
01:39:21,040 --> 01:39:22,880
So he says, and you can only do that

1474
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:25,960
if you're abstracted to the right level.

1475
01:39:25,960 --> 01:39:28,720
And he never gave techniques of doing that.

1476
01:39:28,720 --> 01:39:31,680
But I think the difficulty is in that.

1477
01:39:31,680 --> 01:39:33,640
It's probably so much too bold.

1478
01:39:33,640 --> 01:39:36,760
I mean, an analogy is a relationship

1479
01:39:36,760 --> 01:39:38,240
between two objects.

1480
01:39:38,240 --> 01:39:41,120
And if you're good at making analogies,

1481
01:39:41,120 --> 01:39:46,320
you're a level above just looking at the objects.

1482
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:48,640
You're looking at relationships of objects.

1483
01:39:48,640 --> 01:39:52,040
And regarding the practicing thing,

1484
01:39:52,040 --> 01:39:54,280
it's still related to representations.

1485
01:39:54,280 --> 01:39:57,280
Because at each practice, you're learning

1486
01:39:57,280 --> 01:40:00,040
something new about this type of problems

1487
01:40:00,040 --> 01:40:06,600
that make you better at identifying them in the future.

1488
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:09,680
And it's not like numerous practices.

1489
01:40:09,680 --> 01:40:11,880
The number of practices doesn't matter

1490
01:40:11,880 --> 01:40:14,920
to your ability of solving problems.

1491
01:40:14,920 --> 01:40:17,320
What you learn from each practice,

1492
01:40:17,320 --> 01:40:20,240
if you can do a thing once.

1493
01:40:20,240 --> 01:40:24,880
I have a friend who basically told me how to do math.

1494
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:26,560
You look at a problem and solve it once.

1495
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:30,360
You go back, and you think about how you solved it.

1496
01:40:30,360 --> 01:40:32,720
What's the process you need to solve it?

1497
01:40:32,720 --> 01:40:37,560
So a good problem is make up another problem like this.

1498
01:40:37,560 --> 01:40:39,680
That's essentially what you were learning

1499
01:40:39,680 --> 01:40:40,760
when you were practicing.

1500
01:40:40,760 --> 01:40:44,200
It's probably too hard to grade.

1501
01:40:44,200 --> 01:40:47,600
You can't teach things you can't grade in the modern.

1502
01:40:47,600 --> 01:40:48,400
Yes?

1503
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:53,120
So I would believe that math is too abstract.

1504
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:57,920
And so it's difficult to go from one representation to another.

1505
01:40:57,920 --> 01:40:59,400
And that would be the whole problem.

1506
01:40:59,400 --> 01:41:04,320
I can't learn a new concept without having

1507
01:41:04,320 --> 01:41:09,840
a concept that's very near that concept, that's very similar.

1508
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:14,160
So it's just that if I don't have good representations

1509
01:41:14,160 --> 01:41:15,840
of a lot of things, it's difficult to put

1510
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:17,000
in a new representation.

1511
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:23,160
So when I learn topology, I should know analysis.

1512
01:41:23,160 --> 01:41:25,520
And then I can go from there to there,

1513
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:28,440
because the representation is very close.

1514
01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:32,760
And so people that are good at math,

1515
01:41:32,760 --> 01:41:34,480
maybe they have a lot of representation.

1516
01:41:34,480 --> 01:41:38,440
So it's easier to add a new representation of a thing,

1517
01:41:38,440 --> 01:41:41,360
because it's like close.

1518
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,840
Certainly would be nice to know.

1519
01:41:46,840 --> 01:41:49,400
Like in the same of vectors, I already

1520
01:41:49,400 --> 01:41:54,120
have the concept of the perpendicular lines.

1521
01:41:54,120 --> 01:41:56,320
And so just adding more lines, it's easy.

1522
0
[01:48:24.760 --> 01:48:29.400]  What do you call those poems where there are many verses,
[01:48:29.400 --> 01:48:32.560]  and each verse ends with the same line,
[01:48:32.560 --> 01:48:34.480]  but it means something different each time?
[01:48:37.120 --> 01:48:40.920]  It's a very what?
[01:48:40.920 --> 01:48:45.200]  What's an example of a duet cake, Beethoven poem?
[01:48:45.200 --> 01:48:46.040]  I couldn't hear you.
[01:48:46.040 --> 01:48:47.520]  Well, there's like the villanelle.
[01:48:47.520 --> 01:48:53.080]  It's like a rondo, except that it changes its meaning each time.
[01:48:53.080 --> 01:48:55.440]  And it's the same words.
[01:48:55.440 --> 01:48:57.400]  They're pretty hard to make, I guess.
[01:48:57.400 --> 01:48:59.800]  There's the villanelle, which has a bit of that.
[01:48:59.800 --> 01:49:02.160]  That does it?
[01:49:02.160 --> 01:49:03.800]  There's the famous one that's what, like,
[01:49:03.800 --> 01:49:09.160]  do not go gentle into the night or something.
[01:49:09.160 --> 01:49:14.040]  Rage, rage against the coming of something.
[01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:18.920]  Anyway, I'll email you the Diabelli.
[01:49:18.920 --> 01:49:20.880]  I had a friend, Manfred Kleins, who
[01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:26.120]  wrote this book called Centics, who
[01:49:26.120 --> 01:49:30.560]  used to play that particular Beethoven thing.
[01:49:30.560 --> 01:49:35.200]  Well, last important question.
[01:49:40.200 --> 01:49:41.040]  Thanks for coming.
[01:49:41.040 --> 01:49:42.840]  Thank you.
32,920
But if you have new representations,

1543
01:43:32,920 --> 01:43:36,040
if you assume that they are symbolic representations,

1544
01:43:36,040 --> 01:43:38,360
in this sense, they are kind of generative things.

1545
01:43:38,360 --> 01:43:42,600
You can combine them, and you can make a lot of stuff.

1546
01:43:42,600 --> 01:43:46,680
But usually, when you learn something new,

1547
01:43:46,680 --> 01:43:49,640
like if you learn the rule, there's going to be exceptions.

1548
01:43:49,640 --> 01:43:55,080
So when you repeat things, one of the reasons for that

1549
01:43:55,080 --> 01:44:00,280
might be to find out bugs, which you might have learned.

1550
01:44:00,280 --> 01:44:03,720
Well, now, when you practice a little piece of music

1551
01:44:03,720 --> 01:44:08,680
by repeating, do you change your representation?

1552
01:44:08,680 --> 01:44:13,080
Or do you just repeat and hope it gets better?

1553
01:44:13,080 --> 01:44:16,000
So I think there's a difference between, OK,

1554
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,400
so there's practice in this sense

1555
01:44:18,400 --> 01:44:20,840
of traditional classical music practice.

1556
01:44:20,840 --> 01:44:24,720
And then there's the idea of tinker practice, if you will.

1557
01:44:24,720 --> 01:44:28,480
So I think that the type of practice that I'm advocating

1558
01:44:28,480 --> 01:44:31,520
is the type of practice where you're actually

1559
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:35,000
turning around the concept or the thing, the object,

1560
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:36,480
in your head so that you're looking

1561
01:44:36,480 --> 01:44:38,040
at it from many different perspectives

1562
01:44:38,040 --> 01:44:42,280
and connecting it to many different things, which

1563
01:44:42,280 --> 01:44:45,080
is actually conducive to expanding your representation,

1564
01:44:45,080 --> 01:44:46,680
connecting it to different concepts,

1565
01:44:46,680 --> 01:44:51,120
all the good things that help us remember it and better use it.

1566
01:44:51,120 --> 01:44:55,200
This is very different from the classical music practice,

1567
01:44:55,200 --> 01:45:00,480
which, having been a classical pianist for 18 years,

1568
01:45:00,480 --> 01:45:04,080
it's not a really good way of doing things.

1569
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:09,560
Well, I was wondering, has there been any studies of children?

1570
01:45:09,560 --> 01:45:11,920
Have there been any children who have just

1571
01:45:11,920 --> 01:45:14,880
played piano or some keyboard instrument

1572
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:16,760
and used it all their lives?

1573
01:45:16,760 --> 01:45:18,720
And then they suddenly have something

1574
01:45:18,720 --> 01:45:25,080
where when you press it, where you can control the volume?

1575
01:45:25,080 --> 01:45:26,800
A theramin.

1576
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:27,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1577
01:45:27,520 --> 01:45:30,120
But if a child were very suddenly

1578
01:45:30,120 --> 01:45:32,800
to learn a completely new dimension,

1579
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:37,520
that's the dynamics and how would it react to that.

1580
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:40,080
So I don't know if there are any such cases.

1581
01:45:40,080 --> 01:45:41,520
But I would suspect that you would

1582
01:45:41,520 --> 01:45:45,400
go to a suitably backward place in the nowadays

1583
01:45:45,400 --> 01:45:47,960
and find some children who don't have much.

1584
01:45:47,960 --> 01:45:50,880
There was a nice period in the Media Lab

1585
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:57,760
when we were building three-dimensional theramins

1586
01:45:57,760 --> 01:46:01,360
for Penn of Penn and Teller, because he's

1587
01:46:01,360 --> 01:46:04,680
quite a good musician.

1588
01:46:04,680 --> 01:46:08,320
We're making gadgets so he could wave his hands.

1589
01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:13,180
But I wonder, in classical music,

1590
01:46:13,180 --> 01:46:16,960
there ought to be some very short pieces that

1591
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:18,600
come in 10 variations.

1592
01:46:20,920 --> 01:46:26,520
Because we make children learn fairly long pieces

1593
01:46:26,520 --> 01:46:30,240
where it's just repeating.

1594
01:46:30,240 --> 01:46:32,360
There's the Belvedere pieces, which

1595
01:46:32,360 --> 01:46:38,200
is like 32 or 33 really short pieces.

1596
01:46:38,200 --> 01:46:40,920
Well, but only eight people in the world can play it.

1597
01:46:43,680 --> 01:46:45,560
But I guess the thing with classical music

1598
01:46:45,560 --> 01:46:50,720
is that it kind of just makes you learn this one thing.

1599
01:46:50,720 --> 01:46:54,320
And you learn it by repeating it over and over again.

1600
01:46:54,320 --> 01:46:57,080
Whereas in something like jazz that's more improvisational,

1601
01:46:57,080 --> 01:46:58,240
it's like you have a template.

1602
01:46:58,240 --> 01:46:59,640
And each time you go through it, you

1603
01:46:59,640 --> 01:47:01,880
can traverse a different path through it.

1604
01:47:01,880 --> 01:47:04,720
But even more classical, classical music

1605
01:47:04,720 --> 01:47:06,640
where you're playing the same thing each time,

1606
01:47:06,640 --> 01:47:08,840
I think that there's still a good way of doing it

1607
01:47:08,840 --> 01:47:09,960
and a not so good way.

1608
01:47:09,960 --> 01:47:12,560
The good way being each time you practice it,

1609
01:47:12,560 --> 01:47:14,400
you suddenly vary it somehow.

1610
01:47:14,400 --> 01:47:15,920
You change the expression a bit.

1611
01:47:15,920 --> 01:47:19,800
You play it faster, slower, things like that.

1612
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:23,120
And I guess this goes back to the whole,

1613
01:47:23,120 --> 01:47:26,680
it's like each time you reinforce an idea,

1614
01:47:26,680 --> 01:47:29,800
simply repeating it, well, in the beginning,

1615
01:47:29,800 --> 01:47:32,600
it might help you familiarize yourself with the idea.

1616
01:47:32,600 --> 01:47:35,640
But if you repeat it and vary it slightly each time

1617
01:47:35,640 --> 01:47:37,400
to look at different dimensions of it,

1618
01:47:37,400 --> 01:47:39,240
then you learn it better.

1619
01:47:39,240 --> 01:47:40,920
How many of you know that piece?

1620
01:47:44,320 --> 01:47:46,000
Beethoven's DIABEL?

1621
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:50,640
Well, you should Google it up and listen to it.

1622
01:47:50,640 --> 01:47:51,840
It has 32.

1623
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:53,120
Is it 32?

1624
01:47:53,120 --> 01:47:56,080
I think it's 32, and then there's the original theme.

1625
01:47:56,080 --> 01:47:58,680
So it's like 33 total, maybe.

1626
01:47:58,680 --> 01:48:01,960
The one I like is the next to last, which is

1627
01:48:01,960 --> 01:48:06,400
ba-da-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop the fugue.

1628
01:48:09,820 --> 01:48:12,920
So that'll give you another view of classical music,

1629
01:48:12,920 --> 01:48:15,480
because the pieces are fairly short.

1630
01:48:15,480 --> 01:48:19,760
And they all have some ideas in common.

1631
01:48:19,760 --> 01:48:22,680
And it's sort of like poetry.

1632
01:48:22,680 --> 01:48:24,760
How do you make it?

1633
01:48:24,760 --> 01:48:29,400
What do you call those poems where there are many verses,

1634
01:48:29,400 --> 01:48:32,560
and each verse ends with the same line,

1635
01:48:32,560 --> 01:48:34,480
but it means something different each time?

1636
01:48:37,120 --> 01:48:40,920
It's a very what?

1637
01:48:40,920 --> 01:48:45,200
What's an example of a duet cake, Beethoven poem?

1638
01:48:45,200 --> 01:48:46,040
I couldn't hear you.

1639
01:48:46,040 --> 01:48:47,520
Well, there's like the villanelle.

1640
01:48:47,520 --> 01:48:53,080
It's like a rondo, except that it changes its meaning each time.

1641
01:48:53,080 --> 01:48:55,440
And it's the same words.

1642
01:48:55,440 --> 01:48:57,400
They're pretty hard to make, I guess.

1643
01:48:57,400 --> 01:48:59,800
There's the villanelle, which has a bit of that.

1644
01:48:59,800 --> 01:49:02,160
That does it?

1645
01:49:02,160 --> 01:49:03,800
There's the famous one that's what, like,

1646
01:49:03,800 --> 01:49:09,160
do not go gentle into the night or something.

1647
01:49:09,160 --> 01:49:14,040
Rage, rage against the coming of something.

1648
01:49:14,040 --> 01:49:18,920
Anyway, I'll email you the Diabelli.

1649
01:49:18,920 --> 01:49:20,880
I had a friend, Manfred Kleins, who

1650
01:49:20,880 --> 01:49:26,120
wrote this book called Centics, who

1651
01:49:26,120 --> 01:49:30,560
used to play that particular Beethoven thing.

1652
01:49:30,560 --> 01:49:35,200
Well, last important question.

1653
01:49:40,200 --> 01:49:41,040
Thanks for coming.

1654
01:49:41,040 --> 01:49:42,840
Thank you.
