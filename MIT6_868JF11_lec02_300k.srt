8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:31,120
I usually start by asking if there are any questions,

9
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:34,760
but I thought I'd say a few things about chapter one

10
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,960
and then see if there are any questions.

11
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,000
I can't see the pointer.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,440
Oh, anybody remember how to get word to?

13
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,160
Make its pointer not disappear.

14
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,040
Maybe I mentioned this in the first lecture,

15
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:12,680
but I was taken by this cute poem by Dorothy Parker

16
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,040
because the first chapter was about love and stuff

17
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,800
like that.

18
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,680
So I tried to get the rights to reproduce it,

19
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:29,080
and it turned out that she was angry at all her friends.

20
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:34,640
She must have been a perpetually pissed off person.

21
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:41,600
And so she left all her literary rights to the NAACP,

22
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,240
and I called them up for hours, and they

23
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,240
couldn't find the rights.

24
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:52,760
So finally, so it's in the version of the emotion

25
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:59,800
machine on the web, but I had to resort to Shakespeare

26
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,800
to replace her.

27
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,480
Shakespeare's a slightly better poet,

28
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:11,000
but he's not as funny as Dorothy Parker.

29
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,960
So the first chapter starts out, or it's mostly

30
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:26,800
about all the things we don't understand about the mind,

31
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,040
which is almost everything.

32
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,800
And the first discussion is, well, the whole chapter

33
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,360
is making fun of the most popular ideas.

34
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,780
And the most popular idea of the mind

35
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:50,280
is that people think that they're not doing the thinking,

36
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,280
but there's something inside them that's doing the thinking.

37
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:59,440
And this idea that there is a self

38
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:05,800
is embedded in just about everything we say and think.

39
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,200
And really, it's hard to see how you would do without it.

40
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,680
But if you ask, what is the self,

41
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,800
then since this idea is so popular,

42
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,160
people begin to believe that there is such a thing,

43
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,380
and it takes all sorts of various forms.

44
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:28,220
And the most dangerous form, maybe,

45
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:32,460
is the one that religions exploit,

46
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:37,620
which is that inside a person with all their complications,

47
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,940
there's a little pure essence called the soul, or the self,

48
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:43,660
or whatever you want to call it.

49
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:48,860
And it's impossible to describe it or explain it

50
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:49,900
in physical terms.

51
00:03:49,900 --> 00:04:00,200
And so that is one of the reasons why we think there are

52
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:07,060
two worlds, a physical world and lots of other kinds of worlds.

53
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:12,640
Each of us has some imaginary model of what they are

54
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,600
and what they're in.

55
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:24,900
And philosophers talk about it and existentialists and so on.

56
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,860
So there are lots of problems about our ideas,

57
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,460
about ourselves.

58
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:36,460
And in reading around for half my life,

59
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:42,180
I was puzzled at the strange ideas that are around.

60
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:49,060
And in Aristotle, I find the first intelligible theories

61
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:51,020
of mind and emotions.

62
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:54,460
So if you look at particular Aristotle's,

63
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,500
there are a number of books.

64
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,340
And one of them is called Rhetoric.

65
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:04,460
And it's full of theories about how people reason and influence

66
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,020
each other.

67
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:15,180
And I'll show you some quotes from that.

68
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,020
Because when I look at the history

69
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:21,700
that I've encountered about psychology,

70
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:27,020
Aristotle stands out as being the first and among the best.

71
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:31,540
And as far as I can see, there were no psychologists nearly

72
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,140
as good as him.

73
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:37,500
Of course, we don't know whether there was a him exactly.

74
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,100
Because what we have of Aristotle,

75
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,960
and there's a lot of writing, but it's all cobbled together

76
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:48,160
by students from all sorts of manuscripts by other people,

77
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,720
and people who took notes.

78
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:55,360
And Aristotle claims to have learned a lot from Plato.

79
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,400
We have very little writing from him.

80
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,880
And so there you go three centuries

81
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,600
before the Christian era, as it's called.

82
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,960
And then a couple of thousand years later,

83
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:23,320
you start to find people like Spinoza, and Kant, and John

84
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:29,120
Locke, and David Hume, who start to make psychology theories,

85
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,760
very little of which is as good as the ones that Aristotle

86
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,200
has in all his fragments.

87
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,760
So one question that frequently bothers me,

88
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:45,320
and it should bother everyone, is why did science

89
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,600
disappear for 1,000 years?

90
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:53,840
And the standard explanation is the rise

91
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:59,360
of the great religions, and why did it come back?

92
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,880
And you see with the first signs of anything

93
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,760
like modern science, at least in my view,

94
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,920
with Galileo and Newton, there are

95
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,640
a couple of people before that.

96
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:15,000
There are some people in the Muslim world

97
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,840
who invented some high school algebra,

98
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,880
and they make a big fuss about that.

99
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,780
It looks like Archimedes, in a very recently discovered

100
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:30,760
manuscript, computed an integral.

101
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:34,520
He found the volume of a cone, which is, what is it?

102
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,720
Sixth BH, I forget.

103
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:46,400
Anyway, so why did science disappear?

104
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,640
And why did psychology appear so late?

105
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:53,520
Because there isn't much psychology in the modern sense

106
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:59,840
until 1900, or the late 1800s, with Francis Galton

107
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:05,560
and William James lived around here,

108
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:16,320
and Rudolf Fleiss, Sigmund Freud, starts writing in 1895.

109
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:21,240
People make fun of Freud, as I mentioned last week.

110
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:26,920
But in fact, among other things, how many of you

111
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,200
have read the recent criticisms of Freud,

112
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,000
which claim that he was a complete faker

113
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,120
and never cured a single patient?

114
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,880
This is popular stuff.

115
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,640
I don't believe Freud ever really

116
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:43,360
claimed to cure a single patient.

117
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,480
So the critics, who are really very ferocious,

118
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:51,200
claim that he made up all his data and so forth.

119
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,920
But most of what Freud says is that psychoanalysis

120
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,940
might be a good way to find out what you're really thinking

121
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,720
and discover more about yourself and your goals and so forth.

122
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:10,400
And I had the good or bad luck to be introduced to L. Ron

123
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,760
Hubbard by John.

124
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,760
When I was an undergraduate, John Campbell

125
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:20,240
was the great editor of the, I think

126
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,600
it was called Astounding Science Fiction in those days.

127
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,880
What a marvelous title.

128
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:32,720
And this fairly mediocre science fiction writer, L. Ron Hubbard,

129
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:38,840
invented a new form of psychiatry called,

130
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,800
what was it called?

131
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,640
Dianetics.

132
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,960
It's pretty good.

133
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:50,120
And I'll tell you that story another time.

134
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:55,960
But John Campbell had Thanksgiving in the Commander

135
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:59,600
Hotel every year and invited a bunch of friends.

136
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,360
And I don't remember if that's how

137
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:06,040
I got to meet Asimov and Heinlein and other people.

138
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,800
But anyway, I did, and science fiction

139
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:14,400
had a big influence on me from my actually early years.

140
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:19,080
But starting in college, it got very serious.

141
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:28,520
Anyway, so chapter one starts to talk

142
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:34,200
about this phenomenon of psychology.

143
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:41,600
And one of the funny parts is this little section 3,

144
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:47,360
1.3 of trying to say, what are emotions?

145
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,640
And I looked up emotions in dictionaries.

146
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,920
And can you all read that?

147
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,200
I don't feel like reading aloud.

148
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:03,300
But there's lots of discussion of emotions

149
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,680
and how mysterious and complex they are.

150
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:10,440
And then the marvelous thing is how many words

151
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,520
there are for emotional states.

152
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,280
I think I got 300, but I don't remember.

153
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:24,000
Anyway, here's from A to D. And I don't recall

154
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:31,220
how I found those, but I think that's a lot.

155
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,560
How many words for ways to think are there?

156
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:43,760
Now, that's a serious question because I complained,

157
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,400
maybe, on the next page.

158
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,640
No, I didn't.

159
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,560
I found myself complaining that there were very few words

160
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,040
for ways to think.

161
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:58,240
And then this afternoon, when I was pruning these slides,

162
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,520
it occurred to me that I didn't really try.

163
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:08,060
So maybe I just didn't think enough.

164
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,720
So if there are a couple of hundred words

165
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,720
for everyday emotions, if any of you

166
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,840
can find me a list of 10 or 20 common words

167
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:23,320
for styles of thinking, I'd appreciate it because I

168
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,560
wonder if there are a lot.

169
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,720
And if not, why not?

170
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:35,920
So here's a list of typical situations,

171
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:43,640
grieving for a lost child, panic at being in an enclosed space.

172
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:47,760
I'm not sure any of the words in the list of 300 standard

173
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,600
emotions are good enough to describe

174
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:57,560
how you feel for any of these not unusual states.

175
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:02,240
Have you ever lost control of your car at high speed?

176
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,100
No, but when I first learned to drive,

177
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:07,640
I couldn't believe that you could read signs at the same

178
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,280
time as.

179
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:22,440
Well, anyway, one of the very best psychologists in history,

180
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:28,040
or pair of psychologists, aren't even called psychologists.

181
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:33,840
These are two guys named Conrad Lorenz and Nico Tinbergen.

182
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:37,080
And somebody made up the word ethology.

183
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:40,520
What they study is the behavior of animals.

184
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,880
And in some sense, presumably, they're

185
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,960
studying the psychology of animals

186
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:52,080
because just as with a person, when somebody flies into a rage,

187
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,080
you're not describing their mental state.

188
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,840
You're describing something about how they behave.

189
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:01,120
And so the ethologists, too, are psychologists.

190
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:08,280
And Tinbergen and Lorenz, starting around 1920s,

191
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:12,840
started to analyze the behavior of animals in great detail.

192
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:20,280
And so here's an example of how a certain fish behaves.

193
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,240
I actually forgot which fish it is,

194
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,360
but there's a picture of it in the book.

195
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:33,320
And at different points in its life,

196
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,560
it's in different phases.

197
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:39,000
And this is just one diagram of a dozen

198
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:45,360
for this particular fish and its reproduction, which

199
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,860
involves an environment with plants and other things.

200
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:54,580
And it divides its behavior into parenting, courtship,

201
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:56,860
nesting, and fighting.

202
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:02,340
And then you see each of those as a lot of subdivisions.

203
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:07,560
And Tinbergen and Lorenz and some students

204
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,980
discovered all these things by sitting in front of fish tanks

205
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:15,260
and watching the fish for months and years.

206
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:24,220
Tinbergen also spent years on some beach watching seagulls.

207
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:26,780
And so he has a diagram like this

208
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:31,900
for a particular class of seagulls.

209
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:41,900
When I came to Boston, my friends and I

210
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:46,740
used to go to Nahant and look at these tide pools

211
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:49,420
there, where there are a lot of activities.

212
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,260
And it was very interesting.

213
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:54,260
And I got a big fish tank and imported

214
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,960
all sorts of little animals and plants

215
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:01,020
from the tide pools in Nahant.

216
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:03,700
And I watched them for about a year and didn't learn anything.

217
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:12,100
And that was before I read Tinbergen.

218
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,180
And then I realized there's something

219
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:18,540
about those people, which is they could watch a fish

220
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:21,140
and recognize all sorts of behaviors.

221
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:23,900
And I would just watch a fish and wonder whether it was hungry

222
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,940
or what.

223
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:29,700
Wouldn't you get bored swimming back and forth for three years

224
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,340
in this?

225
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:37,860
Anyway, so here are the great psychologists of our day,

226
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:44,260
Aristotle 2,000 years ago, and Lorentz and Tinbergen

227
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:53,460
in the 1930s, and Sigmund Freud and Galton and William James

228
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:56,100
around 1900.

229
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,660
And then what went wrong?

230
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,620
There's almost no good psychology

231
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:05,420
between then and 1950s, when something called cognitive

232
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,860
psychology started.

233
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:14,060
And it was partly due to people who said,

234
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:17,060
let's make psychology more scientific.

235
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:20,980
And you've probably all heard of Pavlov or Watson.

236
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:26,260
And what happened is around 1900, some psychologists said,

237
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:29,780
well, these Galton's and Freud's and William James

238
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:33,100
are very poetic and expressive and literary.

239
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:38,180
And they write much better than we do and tells good stories.

240
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,500
But they're not scientists.

241
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,500
And they don't do reproducible experiments.

242
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,020
So what we have to do is simplify the situation

243
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:48,060
to find the basic laws of behavior.

244
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:52,780
So let's take a pigeon and put it in a vacuum in the dark.

245
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:58,420
Well, they didn't go that far.

246
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,860
But they did put it in the dark.

247
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:05,980
And there were two illuminated levers to work.

248
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,340
And you could make a sound.

249
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:10,740
And the sound could be very annoying.

250
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:14,620
Or you could have a bright, annoying flashing

251
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,420
light or something.

252
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,780
And the animal would push one of two levers.

253
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:24,060
And one of them would make the stimulus even more annoying.

254
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:27,300
And one of them would make it go away.

255
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:31,380
And you'd plot curves of how often the animal pressed

256
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,300
these levers.

257
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:36,620
So you would get a quantitative theory of how much it learned

258
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:39,460
and how much it could remember and how many trials it

259
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,260
would have to do.

260
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:46,900
Then instead of just looking at reactions to stimuli,

261
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:52,100
they quickly switched to trying to teach the animal things

262
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:57,260
by giving it two alternatives, turn left or turn right

263
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:00,820
or push this button or that or whatever.

264
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:03,100
And if they pushed the one you approve of,

265
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,420
then you'd give them a little pellet of food.

266
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,780
And there was a lot of engineering

267
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:11,420
so that you would make sure that the food got to them

268
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,020
right away.

269
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:15,340
Because if there were a 10-second delay

270
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:19,300
between an action and a reward, the pigeon or a squirrel

271
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:24,020
or a rat or a cat or a dog would learn much less quickly

272
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:26,900
than if there was a one-second delay.

273
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:34,220
And anyway, that went on for 50 years, starting around 1900,

274
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,500
Pavlov and his dogs.

275
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:40,580
And there's a great movie that some guy came around with

276
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:43,980
that had been taken of Pavlov's lab.

277
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:50,300
And it shows sort of like a great dictator or something.

278
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:53,820
There's this room with a lot of cages and dogs and mostly

279
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,580
dogs in this case.

280
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,940
And Pavlov comes in, and there are

281
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,740
a bunch of lackeys who sort of bow and scrape

282
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,780
because he's a lord.

283
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:04,500
And he comes in, and all the dogs

284
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:09,060
run into the corner of their cage and yelp.

285
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:15,020
So the Pavlovians tried pretty hard

286
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,340
to get that movie suppressed.

287
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,740
And I haven't seen it in recent years.

288
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:31,820
But anyway, Fred Skinner, who was a professor when

289
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:36,060
I was an undergraduate at Harvard,

290
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:39,660
was the first one to really automate

291
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,620
this experimental psychology.

292
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:44,380
And he invented what's called a Skinner box,

293
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:49,220
but it's just a soundproof, lightproof, well-ventilated

294
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:52,500
and thermally regulated cage.

295
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,340
And you can put a rat or a pigeon.

296
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:58,180
Those are the most common animals.

297
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:00,500
They're very inexpensive because they're free.

298
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,660
No one knows much about dolphins.

299
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:13,900
They've been studied for 50 years.

300
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,980
Whenever John Watts's name, remember

301
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,420
the name of the great dolphin?

302
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,740
Lily, thanks.

303
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:26,820
He discovered a lot about dolphins

304
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:31,100
and a certain amount about their communication

305
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,940
and a little bit about whales.

306
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:37,140
But there's an interesting mystery.

307
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:42,900
I forget which whales, but some whales have a 20-minute song.

308
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,820
And they repeat it for a whole season.

309
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:48,660
And next year, that song is a little bit different.

310
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,820
But it goes essentially without repeating.

311
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:54,420
It's very complicated for 20 minutes.

312
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:57,100
And people have studied that a lot.

313
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,980
And no one has the slightest idea of what it means.

314
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:06,940
And nobody even has any good conjectures, which bothers me.

315
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:10,100
What I think it probably means is this.

316
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,020
When there's a whole bunch of fish somewhere

317
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:18,220
for one of these whales, it might be 200 miles away.

318
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,900
Whales eat a lot.

319
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:24,580
And it's very important to find where the fish are.

320
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:30,740
And I believe this message, which

321
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:34,980
changes a bit during the season, might be telling you

322
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:40,420
where the food is on the Atlantic or Pacific coastline

323
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,900
in great detail.

324
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:46,340
Because if somebody finds a lot of fish somewhere,

325
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,100
you have to swim 300 miles.

326
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,900
And if they're not there.

327
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:54,780
So anyway, it's interesting that John Lilly got a lot

328
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:59,020
of publicity, but he didn't discover squat.

329
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:04,780
And finally, the dolphin study years

330
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:07,240
gave up because nothing happened.

331
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,940
Anybody have heard anything?

332
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:13,620
I haven't paid any attention for 20 years.

333
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,540
Have you heard of anybody discovering anything

334
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,440
about dolphins?

335
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,060
Except they're very good at solving

336
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,660
a lot of physical problems.

337
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:33,060
Anyway, I'm bothered by the mystery

338
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:39,780
of why was there some psychology in Aristotle's time.

339
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:47,220
And why didn't it get anywhere till 1950

340
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:50,540
when there was regular psychology?

341
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:54,660
But it was afflicted by what I call physics envy.

342
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:57,260
Namely, you run into people like Estes.

343
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,620
And well, he was pretty good, actually.

344
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:03,220
But there are a lot of psychologists who made up

345
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:07,460
things like Maxwell's equations for how animals learn.

346
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:10,420
And there were generally three or four laws.

347
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:16,020
And if there's a sequence of events,

348
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:20,820
then animals remember a lot about the first few

349
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:23,140
and the last few in the sequence.

350
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:25,460
They don't remember much about the middle.

351
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:29,760
And of course, the reliability of their memory

352
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,460
depends a lot on how recent it was

353
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:36,080
and on how powerful the reward was and blah, blah, blah.

354
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,920
And so they get these little sets of rules

355
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,440
that look like Newton's laws.

356
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:45,140
And that was the kind of sort of psychological physics

357
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:50,440
that the so-called behaviorists were mostly looking for.

358
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:54,680
This was not what Tinbergen and Lorentz did,

359
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,400
because they wrote books with extensive descriptions

360
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:02,280
of what the animals did and made little diagrammatic guesses

361
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:05,120
about the structure of the subroutines

362
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,720
and substructures.

363
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:13,320
Anyway, end of history, but it's a nice question.

364
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,960
Why do some sciences grow?

365
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:21,200
And why was psychology just about the last one?

366
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,040
I suspect it was it could have been earlier,

367
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:27,520
but people tried to imitate the physicists

368
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,640
and tried to say maybe there's something like Newton's

369
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,640
or Maxwell's laws for the mind.

370
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,000
And they found a few, but they weren't enough to explain much.

371
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,240
So there are a lot of questions.

372
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:51,260
When Seymour Papert and I started

373
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:58,880
thinking about these things, which was really around 1960,

374
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:06,020
I had been working on some ideas about AI in the late 50s.

375
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:10,800
And my PhD thesis was a theory of neural networks,

376
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:16,240
which was sort of interesting, but never really

377
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,000
went anywhere.

378
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,000
I went to a meeting in London somewhere

379
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,900
and gave a talk about a theory of learning

380
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:29,420
that was based on some neural network ideas.

381
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:33,420
And there was this person from South Africa

382
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:39,100
named Seymour Papert who gave the same paper.

383
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:45,340
And I hope this happens to you someday.

384
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:49,460
Find somebody who thinks so much like you,

385
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:52,700
only different enough that it's worth it

386
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:56,500
and that you only have to say about three words a day

387
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:01,020
and some whole new thing starts, because we really

388
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:04,180
did write the same paper and it had the same equation in it.

389
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:14,140
And he had been working for Piaget,

390
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:17,100
who was the first great child psychologist.

391
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,500
I should have mentioned Piaget, who probably

392
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,500
discovered more things about psychology

393
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,940
than any other single person in history.

394
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:30,540
And there are lots of people now who say,

395
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:37,100
he was wrong about 0.73, because children learned that

396
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:41,180
at the age of 2 and 1 half instead of 2 and 3 quarters.

397
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:44,460
I'm parodying the Piaget critic community,

398
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:47,460
but it's pretty bad.

399
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:52,300
And I think those poor guys are uncomfortable,

400
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:57,020
because Jean Piaget published 20 books full of observations

401
00:27:57,020 --> 00:28:00,220
about children that, as far as I know,

402
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:03,340
no one had made systematically before.

403
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:09,260
And in his later years, he started

404
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:13,140
courting algebraic mathematicians,

405
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:16,100
because he wanted more formal theories.

406
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:22,660
And in my view, he wanted to make his theories worse,

407
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:25,060
and nothing much happened.

408
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:28,580
But he did visit here a couple of times,

409
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:34,220
and it was really exciting to meet

410
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:36,220
the starter of a whole new field.

411
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:45,620
Anyway, Papert and I discussed lots of things,

412
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:51,380
and somehow or other, we kept finding more ideas

413
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,700
about psychology.

414
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:57,300
And it finally gelled into the idea that, well,

415
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,100
if you look at the brain, you know

416
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:02,620
that there are several hundred different brain centers.

417
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,580
What's all that stuff for?

418
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:09,420
And how could it possibly make any sense

419
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:12,420
to try to explain what it does in terms

420
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:16,540
of four laws like Newton?

421
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:19,620
How does a car work?

422
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:22,680
Is there a magical force inside the engine that

423
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,020
causes the wheels to turn?

424
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:27,540
No.

425
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:29,700
There's this funny thing in the back

426
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:32,620
to cause a differential, so that if the car isn't

427
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:37,840
going in a straight line, the two wheels

428
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:43,560
going at different speeds won't rip the.

429
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,800
If the two wheels were going at the same speed,

430
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:49,000
the tread would come off in five minutes.

431
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,960
You ever wonder what a differential is for?

432
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:57,720
So most of the car is fixing bugs in the other parts.

433
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:04,040
Most of the brain is because we started out

434
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:08,040
as fish or lizards or whatever you like.

435
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:12,680
And making the brain bigger wouldn't

436
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:17,080
help much because you'd just get a heavier lizard that

437
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:21,640
had to eat more and would think more slowly.

438
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,200
So size is bad.

439
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:28,200
But on the other hand, if you need another cubic inch

440
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,760
of brain to fix the bugs in the other part,

441
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:41,720
then the evolutionary advantage of being smarter

442
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,060
had better make you able to catch a little more

443
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,760
food per hour.

444
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:52,160
And so each person is an ecology of these different processes.

445
00:30:52,160 --> 00:31:00,000
And the brain reached its present size

446
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,160
about a million years ago, I guess.

447
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,760
What's the current guess?

448
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,480
Anybody been tracked?

449
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,560
They keep discovering new ancestors of humans.

450
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:13,160
And I don't have the patience to read about them

451
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:16,360
because you know that next week somebody will say,

452
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:19,000
oh, that isn't in the main line.

453
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,840
And you were just unlucky to discover that skeleton.

454
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:37,800
So anyway, Papert and I and a lot of students

455
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:41,920
gradually developed this picture that the mind is made

456
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:45,280
of lots of processes or agents or resources

457
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,640
or whatever you want to call them.

458
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,600
And it's anybody's guess what they are.

459
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:55,440
If you look at the anatomy of the brain,

460
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,960
you know that people label regions.

461
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:01,360
So it's very clear that this occipital lobe back here

462
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,000
is largely concerned with vision.

463
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:10,800
But I forget where the one for hearing is.

464
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:14,400
If you destroy the part of the brain

465
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:18,440
for hearing in some animals, you get a little bit

466
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:24,120
of increased function in some part of the visual system

467
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:27,920
that seems to enable the animal to hear a little bit

468
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,240
and make some reactions.

469
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:36,200
And there's a whole lot of hype, I think you have to call it,

470
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:39,240
about the flexibility of the nervous system.

471
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,640
That is, if certain brain areas get destroyed,

472
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,640
other parts take over.

473
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,120
They almost never are as good.

474
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:51,600
And mostly, many functions never get taken over at all

475
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:56,280
but are replaced by ones that superficially seem similar.

476
00:32:56,280 --> 00:33:00,400
And so there's a whole lot of, I guess,

477
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:04,400
wishful thinking that the brain is immensely resourceful

478
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,680
and error-correcting and repairing.

479
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:14,440
I think there was some idea that that was a general phenomenon.

480
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,080
But if you do some arithmetic, you

481
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,680
get an interesting result. Suppose

482
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:23,320
that each function in the brain occurred

483
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:27,800
in 10 different places at random.

484
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:32,240
Then if you removed half the brain,

485
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,640
how many functions would you lose?

486
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,880
Well, almost no arithmetic tells you

487
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,560
you would lose about one part in 1,000.

488
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:50,080
And so, in fact, you would never be able to detect it.

489
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:54,520
So this idea that the brain has enormous redundancy

490
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:57,640
will now change that number to five.

491
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:00,560
Suppose each function is somewhat

492
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:03,440
supported in five different parts of the brain.

493
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:09,480
Then if you take off half the brain, then what am I saying?

494
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:16,280
One part in 32, chance of losing some significant function.

495
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:20,600
So probably lots of things that we do

496
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,120
are supported in several parts of the brain.

497
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:28,000
Apparently, the language center is pretty unique,

498
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:28,920
and some others.

499
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:34,120
But be careful about the conclusions

500
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:38,320
you read from optimistic neuroscientists.

501
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,600
Anyway, Papert and I worked on this idea

502
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:55,800
of how could these large numbers of different processes

503
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,880
be organized.

504
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,880
And we made various theories about it.

505
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:08,800
And then around, I guess, the late 1970s,

506
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,400
we stopped working together.

507
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,400
And Papert developed his revolutionary ideas

508
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:21,960
about education, which certainly have had a lot of influence,

509
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:27,600
although they didn't sweep the world in the way we had hoped.

510
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:31,680
And I kept working on the society of mind theory.

511
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:35,520
And we didn't work together so much,

512
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:41,200
but we still did plenty of criticizing

513
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,480
and supporting of each other.

514
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:49,240
Anyway, my theory ended up with this idea

515
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:52,360
that is sort of based on Freud.

516
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:56,040
I don't know if I kept a picture of his here.

517
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:04,200
Freud concluded that the mind was an interesting arena,

518
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,480
sort of.

519
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:11,360
And he had the mind divided into three parts.

520
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:14,840
At one end of the mind, which were inherited

521
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:18,160
from most other animals, is called

522
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:21,600
the id, which is a bunch of instinctive,

523
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:25,960
mainly built-in behavioral mechanisms.

524
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:32,440
And a second part of the mind is

525
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,600
what he called the superego, which

526
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,600
is a collection of critics.

527
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:42,360
So in Freud's first image, the brain is in two parts.

528
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:45,480
One is a set of instinctive, built-in behaviors.

529
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,960
And the other is a set of critics,

530
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:54,680
which actually are associated with a culture or, well,

531
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,780
culture and a tradition.

532
00:36:56,780 --> 00:37:00,040
And you learn from other people things that are good to do

533
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,360
and things that are bad to do.

534
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:08,200
And that's called the superego.

535
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,480
This is your set of values and standards

536
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,920
and tests for suitable behavior.

537
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,440
And the middle is this strange object

538
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:22,480
called the ego, which is not what people think it is.

539
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,600
At least Freud's word, the ego is

540
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:27,400
a kind of big, neutral battleground

541
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:35,040
where the instinctive behaviors I keep wanting to.

542
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,640
Oh, you can see that arrow if I take my finger off it.

543
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,980
And then gradually, as I kept trying

544
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:52,460
to figure out how problems are solved

545
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:57,100
and what kind of processes might be involved,

546
00:37:57,100 --> 00:38:00,780
I got this picture, which has six layers.

547
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:04,860
And various people come around and say,

548
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:08,620
I don't think you need to distinguish between layers

549
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:11,140
four and five.

550
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:16,340
Why don't you just lump all the three top layers into one?

551
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:25,260
And I sort of laugh quietly and say,

552
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:28,700
these people are trying to find a physics-like, unified,

553
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:31,380
minimal theory of psychology.

554
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:34,140
And they're probably right in one sense.

555
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:36,320
But if they do that, they'll get stuck.

556
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,460
Because if you get a new idea, there'll be no place to put it.

557
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:47,420
So if you have something that's very mysterious,

558
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:51,300
don't imitate the physicists.

559
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:54,940
Because if you make a theory that's exactly right

560
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:58,900
and just accounts for the data and there's nothing extra

561
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:05,080
and nothing loose, then when you notice a new phenomenon,

562
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:10,320
like dark matter, then the physicists

563
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,480
don't know what to do.

564
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:17,760
Should they regard dark matter as some obscure feature

565
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,000
of spacetime, or does it have something

566
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,240
to do with this universe being near another one

567
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,480
that you can't otherwise communicate with?

568
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:30,040
And it's all very puzzling.

569
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:33,080
But there are lots of things that don't fit into Newton's

570
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,040
laws these days.

571
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:42,200
And I'm not suggesting a six-layer theory of physics,

572
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,560
but it might be worth a try.

573
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,600
OK, so what am I?

574
00:39:52,600 --> 00:40:03,760
I made up some nice slides, but I think I'll stop.

575
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,600
So who has some questions?

576
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:11,240
And what would you like to see in a theory of psychology?

577
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:14,880
What do you want to be explained?

578
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:21,200
A lot of people are convinced that there

579
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,720
are some really serious problems and mysteries,

580
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,720
like what is consciousness?

581
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:36,880
And if you look at chapter 4, my feeling

582
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:43,400
is consciousness is an etymological accident

583
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:47,840
that people got a word, which is a suitcase for all

584
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,400
of the things they don't understand

585
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,280
about the mind and more.

586
00:40:52,280 --> 00:41:00,400
But once you've got a word and it goes in the culture,

587
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,560
consider the word consciousness for a minute

588
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,720
from a legal point of view.

589
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:08,600
Suppose that you happen to be walking along,

590
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:16,040
and you're carrying something.

591
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,080
Where is that pointer?

592
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,600
And it happens to stick somebody's eye out.

593
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:29,480
Then it's very important when they sue you

594
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:32,000
to establish whether you meant to do it

595
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,200
or whether it was an accident.

596
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,000
Did you consciously plan to?

597
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:45,000
I can't think of the English word for it.

598
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,480
I can't think of the English word

599
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:50,160
for putting somebody's eye out.

600
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:56,080
There's beheading and also gouges is a good word.

601
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:08,120
So anyway, it's very important for social reasons

602
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:13,320
to have a word for whether an action was deliberately

603
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:18,400
violating the rules as opposed to accidentally violating

604
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:23,360
the rules, like if you tripped on the stairs

605
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:27,080
and landed on somebody and broke their neck.

606
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:30,480
That's not a crime unless you were

607
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:36,120
so clever as to make it appear that it was an accident.

608
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,960
Anyway, you see what I mean?

609
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:44,560
So our whole system of fairness and ethics

610
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,880
and social responsibility is based

611
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:51,460
on the distinction between whether an action was

612
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:54,360
deliberate or not.

613
00:42:54,360 --> 00:43:01,240
And so did he do that consciously is a word for that.

614
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:04,400
And somehow the idea of conscious became elevated.

615
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,360
Well, that's a very superficial.

616
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:09,280
You can probably think of 10 other reasons

617
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:12,960
why a word like that.

618
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:13,680
Yes?

619
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:18,320
Yeah, Martin, sometimes in your writing,

620
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,400
it seems to me that there's both sides of it.

621
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,680
Sometimes you argue with both sides of it.

622
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:26,360
It seems like in that kind of, I can well imagine

623
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:28,080
there's that kind of representation.

624
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,640
You have representation of self and representation

625
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:31,920
of your mind.

626
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,760
But then you say there's no self or no consciousness.

627
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,880
Why can't you think about consciousness

628
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,680
as just a process that is reasoning about your own mind?

629
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,640
Is there a problem with that?

630
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,760
I understand you don't want to talk about soul

631
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,960
because that's a religious notion.

632
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,160
No, but sometimes when you say conscious, that is,

633
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:53,040
do you remember doing it?

634
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:53,880
Which is?

635
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,600
Yeah, but don't I load up my process

636
00:43:55,600 --> 00:44:00,160
that asks me what I think about my own mind?

637
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:03,640
And then I retrieve that and I say, yeah, I do remember it.

638
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:06,080
Well, you're right, actually.

639
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:08,600
I went to a lot of trouble to find

640
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:13,160
25 or 30 different uses for the word consciousness.

641
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:17,360
And probably if one of us worked harder,

642
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,000
we could take those and condense them

643
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:23,600
into five or six much better ones that account for more

644
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:24,720
stuff than the 30.

645
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:27,280
Well, I think you've got five right there, ideas, goals,

646
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,240
memory, thoughts, and feelings, right?

647
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:31,000
That might be just right for something.

648
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:42,880
Yes, well, I think that's a great criticism of one reason

649
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:46,480
why people don't like these theories quite so much,

650
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:50,280
because I propose too many things.

651
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:56,760
I really should reprint that criticism from Restak

652
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:01,480
or hand it out, because it's this neurologist who says,

653
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:04,720
why is he telling us all these things about k-lines

654
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:11,080
and representations and so forth?

655
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:15,560
The answer is, he's from a community

656
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:18,020
that doesn't have enough variety yet.

657
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:21,960
And I'd be the first to admit that I

658
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:26,440
try to go overboard and think of five more things

659
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:27,760
than are in the literature.

660
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:37,000
But that emotion thing is nice.

661
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,200
Remember, that was a serious challenge,

662
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:46,440
because when I made that list, I do have a laser pointer

663
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:50,600
somewhere in my jacket, probably.

664
00:45:54,840 --> 00:46:00,640
How many words for at least noticeably distinct ways

665
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:03,720
of thinking, or reasoning, or figuring out,

666
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:08,080
or solving problems can you think of?

667
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:12,160
Maybe there are 20 or 30.

668
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:16,840
I just realized this afternoon that I never looked.

669
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,480
I don't remember where I got this list.

670
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:25,800
Yeah?

671
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:28,200
Can I ask about your perception of free will?

672
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:32,640
And I got it from a reading that you don't have a strong sense

673
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,680
of free will, and so what is that?

674
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:37,920
I think it's the same as the one for consciousness.

675
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,700
Namely, it's a legal concept.

676
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:44,360
The idea of free will is completely obscene, isn't it?

677
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:46,760
What could it possibly mean if you

678
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:48,080
did something for no reason?

679
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:54,560
So it's a thoroughly empty idea, isn't it?

680
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:57,920
Or what do you mean by it?

681
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,000
Do you mean there's nobody ordering you around,

682
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,760
so you're free to do whatever you want?

683
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,160
But of course, you're not.

684
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:09,920
You can only do what your computer computes you to do.

685
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,200
In a sense, in the same way that you

686
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:19,080
draw in the fish diagram, the fish's actions

687
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:23,400
are products of the environment and of its current state,

688
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:26,080
and it's essentially a Turing machine.

689
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:28,280
Well, it's some kind of machine, yes, sure.

690
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:30,760
And so would you argue that we are also

691
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:33,680
Turing machines that are just running out in the world?

692
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,880
Sure.

693
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:40,480
I've never heard of any even interesting alternative.

694
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,800
In other words, people who insist on free will

695
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,800
appear to me to be like people who

696
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:50,080
believe that there must be a god who created the world.

697
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:51,660
What's the next step?

698
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:53,900
Who created the god?

699
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:55,700
They don't take that step.

700
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:59,100
So if your will is free, OK, then who is controlling it?

701
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:04,140
There's nothing there.

702
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:09,460
But legally, it's great, because if somebody stole

703
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:12,620
so many of their own free will.

704
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:15,900
But suppose you were a peculiar kind of epileptic,

705
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:17,700
and every now and then when you go by,

706
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:27,580
your hand goes out and steals things.

707
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:32,100
Then they, what do they do?

708
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:33,100
They put you on parole?

709
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:37,300
This is very strange.

710
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:39,140
But if you look at religions, you

711
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:43,220
see that people make money on them.

712
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:48,380
13% of the world's product goes to people

713
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:51,500
who make their living on concepts like free will

714
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:53,460
and consciousness.

715
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:56,020
So it's a big money thing.

716
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:58,500
It's not just an accident.

717
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:01,340
It's an industry.

718
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:04,820
So both of those are constructs of society.

719
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:07,660
And if you could imagine a society

720
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:10,020
without the concept of consciousness and free will,

721
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:11,820
those are requirements for being free.

722
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:13,080
I don't think you could.

723
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:17,000
You'd have to make up something to keep people in check

724
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,560
and under control and to train them.

725
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:25,640
It's like the rat needs somebody to press the reward or punish

726
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:28,000
button.

727
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,760
And we have it built into our culture

728
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:34,720
works because you build into people's head

729
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:37,280
the machinery for suppressing doubt.

730
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:42,360
And it's very clever.

731
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:45,360
But you should think of it as an industry rather

732
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:49,280
than an inexplicable phenomenon.

733
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:52,000
How much money goes into it?

734
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Yes?

735
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,200
How many ways of thinking can you think of?

736
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,240
Say it again.

737
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:59,960
How many ways of thinking can you think of right now?

738
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:01,480
That's my challenge, in fact.

739
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:11,440
There's probably a big list in some chapter or other,

740
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:12,800
but there's nothing like this.

741
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,200
What's the trick?

742
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,280
If I go like that.

743
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:30,460
Actually, Dragon has a thing, so you can tell it

744
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:32,700
to make things bigger.

745
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:38,260
How many of you used the new Dragon program speech thing?

746
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:41,700
I can't believe how good it is.

747
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:44,860
Oh, I was talking to Henry Lieberman about it earlier.

748
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:49,580
Yes?

749
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:51,380
So I'm under the impression that you

750
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:53,700
would say that the side of mind theory

751
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:57,300
applies both to humans and animals.

752
00:50:57,300 --> 00:51:02,780
Is it just that we have higher levels of organization in them?

753
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:05,180
So where would you draw that line?

754
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:07,380
Like, do animals not have a notion of the self

755
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:11,180
the way you described it, like long-term planning and stuff?

756
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:12,420
That's a great question.

757
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:20,780
And it'd be interesting to think about ways to investigate it.

758
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:26,940
And researchers are often, in fact,

759
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:31,100
raising that question of, do animals

760
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:34,220
have a representation of themselves?

761
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:36,340
And there's a famous experiment, but I

762
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:40,460
can't remember what its current status is,

763
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:46,420
where you put a red dot on a chimpanzee's head.

764
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:52,140
And when the chimp passes a mirror and sees that,

765
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:55,500
the chimp might go like that.

766
00:51:55,500 --> 00:52:02,180
Whereas I don't think a dog, when it passes a mirror,

767
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:11,180
would rub its forehead to see if it has a red spot.

768
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:13,900
I had a cat who walked past mirrors,

769
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:17,820
because we have some wall, full-size mirrors

770
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:20,260
around the house.

771
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:21,780
And the cat walks by, and there's

772
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:23,740
this other cat going in the mirror.

773
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:26,900
And she pays no attention to it, whatever.

774
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:31,380
So of course, I don't know what happened the first three times

775
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:34,220
she walked by that mirror, because if you

776
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:39,220
see another cat going by, you'd think it would.

777
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:43,580
Anyway, it's a good question, and people ask that.

778
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:46,780
And there's some evidence that elephants

779
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:57,020
have a model of themselves, and maybe dolphins.

780
00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:59,700
And I don't know where.

781
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:02,900
Have any of you heard any stories of other animals

782
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:08,940
that can recognize, for example, when they've been painted?

783
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:09,460
Which?

784
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:10,980
Elephants?

785
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:13,540
Yes, I think elephants.

786
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:17,500
If things can't, the dolphins don't know when things can.

787
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:19,260
So there's a famous child psychology

788
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:22,300
experiment where, if you're less than a couple months old,

789
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:24,980
you actually fail this test.

790
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:25,980
Oh.

791
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:28,500
So it's actually something that comes

792
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:32,340
and is a sign of your child progressing.

793
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:36,220
So it might not be intrinsic to humanity in every sense.

794
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:41,620
So I'm sure an invention that you probably can do, yeah.

795
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:43,820
This is off the topic, but I once

796
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:49,660
had a great email correspondence with some woman who

797
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:57,380
was getting a PhD in France about how babies

798
00:53:57,380 --> 00:54:00,060
recognize their mothers.

799
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:04,460
And she concluded with, you did experiments

800
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:07,820
after having other people walk into the room

801
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:12,540
with a mask of the mother or a different hairdo and so forth.

802
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:14,620
And for the first two months or three months,

803
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:18,860
I think, it turned out that the baby recognizes the mother

804
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:22,460
by the hairdo, which had not been known.

805
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:31,360
Then I think after three months, it's recognizing the mother

806
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:32,980
by a face.

807
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:38,580
And at that point, she's doing experiments

808
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:40,220
where you get another woman wearing

809
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:44,020
the face, a copy of the mother's face.

810
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:47,020
And so now there's two mothers, and the baby

811
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:48,860
is absolutely delighted.

812
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:55,840
And then, as I can't remember, but then I

813
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:58,780
think at four or five months, when

814
00:54:58,780 --> 00:55:00,340
two copies of the mother comes in,

815
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:03,900
the baby gets really panicked.

816
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:09,520
So I lost track of her.

817
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:11,400
If you have a baby, let me know.

818
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:23,960
She got her PhD for this, and I haven't heard anything since.

819
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:24,800
Yes?

820
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:27,320
Here's a sort of half-formulated thought

821
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:30,800
that I just thought of regarding ways of thinking

822
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,400
and ways of feeling.

823
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,840
So it just occurred to me that it

824
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:36,840
seems like, if you go back to the list of feelings,

825
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:38,960
it seems like when we talk about feeling,

826
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,360
we're talking about a state that the brain is in.

827
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:43,280
So it might be a complicated state that's

828
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:46,600
like some combination of a lot of different parameters,

829
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:48,160
but it's a state that you can stay in

830
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:50,320
for an arbitrary amount of time.

831
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:52,960
But I think thinking is something

832
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:55,920
that's more sequential, as in when you're thinking

833
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,680
you're necessarily changing the state of your brain

834
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:00,960
all the time because you're moving bits around.

835
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,400
So I don't know.

836
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,600
I just thought of it that way.

837
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:06,440
No, I think that's right.

838
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:09,440
When we talk about intelligent behavior,

839
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:10,840
you're absolutely right.

840
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:14,420
What you've got is a process that's criticizing itself

841
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:19,200
and seeing when you got stuck and finding things to do.

842
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:27,160
And I suppose in each emotional state,

843
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:29,560
you're certainly also thinking.

844
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:33,040
So that's going on, but maybe it's more restricted,

845
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:37,760
like if you're confronting somebody

846
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:42,960
and there's a sort of conflict, then almost all your thoughts

847
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:47,280
are constrained to that subject.

848
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:53,960
And it's not as resourceful, but I'm just improvising.

849
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:56,520
Or perhaps for each emotional state,

850
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:58,440
when we say that we're in an emotional state,

851
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:00,120
the things that we're talking about

852
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:04,400
are the certain switches that get flipped in a certain state

853
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:07,000
or something that's above a certain threshold.

854
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,920
And you can have thoughts that are

855
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:12,120
about anything in that state, but perhaps the state itself

856
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:15,120
influences the type of thoughts that you're likely to have.

857
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:19,400
OK, I think what I'm talking about in this context

858
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:25,120
is sort of extreme forms where the person changes

859
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:29,120
into another machine, and it's like an angry person

860
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:34,640
won't listen to reason, or it's very hard to deflect them.

861
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:38,880
And so it's this kind of rigid thing.

862
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:42,180
But humans are generally are rarely

863
00:57:42,180 --> 00:57:45,660
in such extreme states where nothing gets through.

864
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:55,140
The whole point of that was that I just

865
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:59,780
realized that I maybe was just too lazy,

866
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:03,740
that we have this huge vocabulary of nuances

867
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:05,900
of emotional activity.

868
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:09,180
And also, people think that these

869
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:14,620
are hard to explain and mysterious and non-physical

870
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:16,700
and blah, blah, blah.

871
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:20,780
But why do we wait till next week

872
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:24,500
and see if somebody comes up with or see if we can come up

873
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:30,780
with a set of 30 or 40 words about intellectual states,

874
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:36,140
curiosity of I just don't know how many there are.

875
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:39,540
And I haven't thought of any in the last few minutes.

876
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:40,500
Yes?

877
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:42,580
Has anybody thought of a couple of?

878
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:47,340
What's the word?

879
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:48,220
What's the word?

880
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:51,860
Like when you're really engaged in some activity

881
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:57,780
that you're doing and you're really in the zone.

882
00:58:57,780 --> 00:59:01,660
Yes, there's a state of keeping other things out

883
00:59:01,660 --> 00:59:06,380
so you can focus, not being interruptible.

884
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:07,220
Yes?

885
00:59:07,220 --> 00:59:12,180
So in this side of mind, you talk about agents

886
00:59:12,180 --> 00:59:14,940
and how they divide between themselves.

887
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:24,100
But I don't see anywhere about how evolution modified a lot

888
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:24,980
agents.

889
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:28,140
Like I believe that evolution modified the way we

890
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:29,220
think right now.

891
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:33,220
I don't know if you saw there is a paper

892
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:37,620
wrote like two years ago that's called The Region of Behavior.

893
00:59:37,620 --> 00:59:42,500
And this guy tried to explain how we make some decisions.

894
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:49,100
Evolutionary, like in a point of view of our speech,

895
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:51,980
we are maximizing the probability

896
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:57,220
of we reproducing ourselves.

897
00:59:57,220 --> 01:00:03,060
But individually, we are not increasing these efficiencies.

898
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:10,460
And I think somehow the decisions of agents or resources

899
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:13,540
would be very determined by evolution

900
01:00:13,540 --> 01:00:18,820
since we have a very long time of evolution

901
01:00:18,820 --> 01:00:20,260
of the human being.

902
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:24,780
And somehow we have hardwired to make some decisions.

903
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:29,780
So for example, he gives the example of a guy.

904
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:32,060
Well, for lizards, that's certainly true.

905
01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:37,820
But why do you use humans keep changing their environment?

906
01:00:37,820 --> 01:00:40,340
So for example, yeah.

907
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:43,940
So he gives this example of tossing a coin.

908
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:47,900
The guy says that this coin is unfair.

909
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:50,980
And he doesn't say the probabilities.

910
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:54,060
But there is 75% of getting heads

911
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:57,700
and 25% of getting tails.

912
01:00:57,700 --> 01:01:01,740
And like the subjects, they choose

913
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:08,660
randomly 25% of the time the tails,

914
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:15,180
even though they can take account of the number of times

915
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:16,660
that you put heads.

916
01:01:16,660 --> 01:01:20,500
And even though if you choose always heads,

917
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:22,460
you would get more money or whatever.

918
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:27,340
You would make the right decision.

919
01:01:27,340 --> 01:01:30,180
That's called probability matching.

920
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:32,660
And it's not a good strategy.

921
01:01:32,660 --> 01:01:34,660
Yeah, but humans do that.

922
01:01:34,660 --> 01:01:35,380
No.

923
01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:38,700
Well, they do it if the psychologist rigs

924
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:41,620
the experiment very carefully.

925
01:01:41,620 --> 01:01:43,580
It turns out that the best thing to do.

926
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:46,420
What do you think is the optimal strategy?

927
01:01:46,420 --> 01:01:47,340
No.

928
01:01:47,340 --> 01:01:49,100
The optimal strategy turns out it's

929
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:52,780
the square roots of the probabilities normalized

930
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:55,380
to add up to 1.

931
01:01:55,380 --> 01:01:59,500
And I'll give you a proof next time.

932
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:01,620
This theorem is due to Ray Solomonoff,

933
01:02:01,620 --> 01:02:06,180
who invented inductive probability theory.

934
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:08,740
But like evolution.

935
01:02:08,740 --> 01:02:13,940
So evolution, if evolution did probability matching,

936
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:15,500
then it would be wrong.

937
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:18,820
And I bet you'll find out that those experiments are wrong.

938
01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:24,100
You have to see.

939
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:27,300
How did he rig the experiment so that people,

940
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:32,620
if it's probability 25%, they guess that 25%?

941
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:35,540
They made the experiments with goldfish.

942
01:02:35,540 --> 01:02:38,380
I don't know.

943
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:42,220
There was a theory about why you would expect it.

944
01:02:42,220 --> 01:02:43,700
It's a good question.

945
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:46,620
I don't think people use probabilities, though.

946
01:02:46,620 --> 01:02:50,540
So even if an experiment shows some,

947
01:02:50,540 --> 01:02:53,940
I would look for a flaw in the design of the experiment.

948
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:01,780
Yes.

949
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:05,060
So Professor Lindsay, you talked a lot about motion

950
01:03:05,060 --> 01:03:06,260
in today's lecture.

951
01:03:06,260 --> 01:03:10,820
And my understanding is that if someone

952
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:15,580
has a specific personality, they might have a predisposition

953
01:03:15,580 --> 01:03:21,660
to feel a certain motion, like anger, depression, or whatnot.

954
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:27,060
My question is that if you had any insider theories on to what

955
01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:33,620
extent our personality is affected by events or influences

956
01:03:33,620 --> 01:03:36,940
that happened to us over the course of a lifetime,

957
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:39,660
and to what extent is it impacted

958
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:44,660
by chemical or biological makeup of our brain?

959
01:03:44,660 --> 01:03:50,140
Well, you're asking, what do people learn?

960
01:03:50,140 --> 01:03:54,500
We don't care if it's chemical or, see, if it's chemical,

961
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:55,380
it's still physical.

962
01:04:00,260 --> 01:04:03,540
I read a little bit of that sort of treatments

963
01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:05,060
for depression.

964
01:04:05,060 --> 01:04:10,660
And the argument is that a lot of the reasons for depression

965
01:04:10,660 --> 01:04:15,300
is because of some sort of chemical or biological way

966
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:17,180
our brain is constructed.

967
01:04:17,180 --> 01:04:18,980
Well, there's lots of complicated things

968
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:20,580
about the brain.

969
01:04:20,580 --> 01:04:25,420
One feature of the brain that I don't know if everybody,

970
01:04:25,420 --> 01:04:28,980
you know that there are inhibitory and excitatory

971
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:30,180
synapses.

972
01:04:30,180 --> 01:04:35,380
When one neuron connects to another,

973
01:04:35,380 --> 01:04:41,220
the impulse that goes along the axon to the target neuron

974
01:04:41,220 --> 01:04:45,500
may reduce the probability or the strength of its firing

975
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:46,980
or increase it.

976
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:55,340
So that's called inhibiting or exciting.

977
01:04:55,340 --> 01:04:58,940
That's not quite the right word, is it?

978
01:04:58,940 --> 01:05:02,460
Now, generally, in the nervous system, as a rule,

979
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:06,420
but not always, if you follow a chain of activity,

980
01:05:06,420 --> 01:05:12,980
it goes inhibiting, exciting, inhibiting, exciting.

981
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:16,740
If you had too many excitatory things and there was a loop,

982
01:05:16,740 --> 01:05:20,540
then it would explode and it would wear itself out

983
01:05:20,540 --> 01:05:22,740
and jig time.

984
01:05:22,740 --> 01:05:26,020
So there is this general feature of the anatomy

985
01:05:26,020 --> 01:05:28,340
that you alternate.

986
01:05:28,340 --> 01:05:30,420
So when somebody talks about a drug having

987
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:34,380
an inhibitory effect, that's sort of weird

988
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:36,620
because it's inhibiting half the neurons

989
01:05:36,620 --> 01:05:42,740
and therefore lowering the thresholds of the ones

990
01:05:42,740 --> 01:05:44,980
they're connected to and so on.

991
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:47,940
So I think the best thing is until you

992
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:51,900
have a diagram of the functional relations

993
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:55,980
between different brain centers, it

994
01:05:55,980 --> 01:06:00,020
might be best not to try to make generalizations about how

995
01:06:00,020 --> 01:06:02,020
the chemistry works.

996
01:06:02,020 --> 01:06:09,140
It's easy, but people think of adrenaline as a stimulant,

997
01:06:09,140 --> 01:06:11,220
but in the nervous epinephrine.

998
01:06:11,220 --> 01:06:14,980
But in the nervous system, locally,

999
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:19,260
it may be inhibiting things that are inhibiting something else.

1000
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:21,340
And so it appears to be exciting.

1001
01:06:21,340 --> 01:06:22,820
Yes?

1002
01:06:23,820 --> 01:06:26,380
I have a problem understanding the difference

1003
01:06:26,380 --> 01:06:28,340
between thoughts and emotions.

1004
01:06:28,340 --> 01:06:30,940
I know it might be a simple thing,

1005
01:06:30,940 --> 01:06:34,460
but since the only thing that I can separate in my mind

1006
01:06:34,460 --> 01:06:39,500
is that thoughts, so let's call it a time constant,

1007
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:42,060
I can change it kind of rapidly.

1008
01:06:42,060 --> 01:06:47,100
Emotions, time constant is small, and I can control it again,

1009
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:48,260
much less.

1010
01:06:48,260 --> 01:06:52,180
But since there is no, at least in this class,

1011
01:06:52,180 --> 01:06:57,620
there is no free will, how can I make a decision

1012
01:06:57,620 --> 01:07:01,700
on where the dividing line between these two entities is?

1013
01:07:01,700 --> 01:07:05,700
Oh, I think it's a waste of time.

1014
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:08,980
As far as I can see, emotional mechanisms

1015
01:07:08,980 --> 01:07:13,500
are generally lower level, simpler ones

1016
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:17,420
than the ones that involve several layers of the,

1017
01:07:17,420 --> 01:07:18,580
more layers of the brain.

1018
01:07:18,580 --> 01:07:20,940
So it's just a relative thing.

1019
01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:24,060
It's not that some states are emotional.

1020
01:07:24,060 --> 01:07:26,680
You're always having some high level thoughts

1021
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:28,820
and low level thoughts.

1022
01:07:28,820 --> 01:07:31,380
And the distinction, I just don't

1023
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:36,820
know why the distinction has occupied so much attention.

1024
01:07:36,820 --> 01:07:39,380
I think it's because, and that goes back

1025
01:07:39,380 --> 01:07:43,280
to having more words for, or asking,

1026
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:46,940
how many words do we have for ways to think?

1027
01:07:46,940 --> 01:07:49,780
It seems to me that in popular culture,

1028
01:07:49,780 --> 01:07:52,560
there are very few words for ways to think,

1029
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:58,840
and lots of words for emotions, and so they're very prominent.

1030
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:02,260
Maybe you have to be smarter to distinguish between ways

1031
01:08:02,260 --> 01:08:07,140
to think, and people generally are dumb.

1032
01:08:07,140 --> 01:08:09,580
Not because they're inherently dumb,

1033
01:08:09,580 --> 01:08:15,020
but they come from cultures which bully you if you,

1034
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:18,740
you know what happens if you're in third grade and you're smart.

1035
01:08:18,740 --> 01:08:22,180
You get it beaten out of you, and you learn not to show it.

1036
01:08:27,580 --> 01:08:30,980
I kind of think like that question of why science

1037
01:08:30,980 --> 01:08:32,700
happened earlier, like why don't we

1038
01:08:32,700 --> 01:08:37,660
have more ways to describe different ways to think.

1039
01:08:37,660 --> 01:08:40,380
And that's sort of puzzling, but have we just not

1040
01:08:40,380 --> 01:08:42,740
reflected as much on the different thinking

1041
01:08:42,740 --> 01:08:45,900
states or different approaches?

1042
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:48,740
I wonder if the Greeks had more, but we didn't.

1043
01:08:48,740 --> 01:08:53,980
I think they did, I think they had also more concept of ideas

1044
01:08:53,980 --> 01:08:57,460
in different states, in different potencies.

1045
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:03,780
Who has a theory of that?

1046
01:09:03,780 --> 01:09:05,780
What's your theory of the Middle Ages?

1047
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:13,860
How could things get so dark for so long?

1048
01:09:13,860 --> 01:09:18,580
Well, I do have a theory, but I didn't.

1049
01:09:18,580 --> 01:09:21,500
And are we about to have one?

1050
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:23,820
I think it has as much to do with the channels

1051
01:09:23,820 --> 01:09:28,100
in which one can communicate ideas to other people,

1052
01:09:28,100 --> 01:09:31,220
whether they exist or not, or whether the attributes

1053
01:09:31,220 --> 01:09:34,020
are underclosed.

1054
01:09:34,020 --> 01:09:35,460
The Middle Ages were characterized

1055
01:09:35,460 --> 01:09:38,260
by scientific discoveries being kept as family secrets.

1056
01:09:38,260 --> 01:09:46,180
Ah, Carden knew how to take Hume roots,

1057
01:09:46,180 --> 01:09:48,380
and he wouldn't tell anyone.

1058
01:09:48,380 --> 01:09:51,180
Well, the classic stupid example is baby tunnels,

1059
01:09:51,180 --> 01:09:55,660
which for 300 years made a single Italian family very rich.

1060
01:09:55,660 --> 01:09:58,140
Using tunnels to extract a baby in childbirth

1061
01:09:58,140 --> 01:10:01,980
increased success rate in difficult births by about 10%,

1062
01:10:01,980 --> 01:10:02,480
they say.

1063
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:02,980
Wow.

1064
01:10:02,980 --> 01:10:05,660
And that was enough to build a family fortune,

1065
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:08,020
until some servant finally spilled jeans,

1066
01:10:08,020 --> 01:10:10,500
and that was the end of that.

1067
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:11,460
Yeah, wow.

1068
01:10:14,620 --> 01:10:18,500
So who has a theory of the Middle Ages?

1069
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:19,780
Is there a standard theory?

1070
01:10:19,780 --> 01:10:20,900
Yes.

1071
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:23,540
Well, the concept of the Middle Ages as the Dark Ages

1072
01:10:23,540 --> 01:10:26,860
is something that emerged mostly in the Renaissance, when

1073
01:10:26,860 --> 01:10:31,260
people in the 14th, well, 15th, 16th century

1074
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:33,700
tried to present themselves as going back

1075
01:10:33,740 --> 01:10:36,780
to the classical age of the scholarship of ancient Greece

1076
01:10:36,780 --> 01:10:40,220
and Rome, and as being better than their predecessor

1077
01:10:40,220 --> 01:10:41,740
for the last few years.

1078
01:10:41,740 --> 01:10:45,180
This mostly happened because of discovery of manuscripts

1079
01:10:45,180 --> 01:10:47,620
that were translated from the ancient Greek,

1080
01:10:47,620 --> 01:10:53,020
and in certain cases, Latin, by Muslims, who at the time

1081
01:10:53,020 --> 01:10:56,460
were sort of receding from Europe.

1082
01:10:56,460 --> 01:10:58,740
So the entire concept of the Middle Ages

1083
01:10:58,740 --> 01:11:01,820
might be a fabrication of the Renaissance.

1084
01:11:01,820 --> 01:11:04,340
There were some significant discoveries at the time.

1085
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:05,220
That's a nice idea.

1086
01:11:05,220 --> 01:11:09,180
In other words, when was St. Patrick?

1087
01:11:09,180 --> 01:11:10,460
St. Patrick.

1088
01:11:10,460 --> 01:11:18,460
I'm told that he popularized a lot of technical manuscripts,

1089
01:11:18,460 --> 01:11:20,340
brought them back into Europe.

1090
01:11:24,620 --> 01:11:26,060
He has two achievements.

1091
01:11:26,060 --> 01:11:29,660
One was bringing scientific culture back,

1092
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:34,300
and the other was getting snakes out of England or something.

1093
01:11:34,300 --> 01:11:35,940
Ireland.

1094
01:11:35,940 --> 01:11:39,540
I don't know which he was sainted for.

1095
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:41,620
Don't you have to do three miracles, or is it?

1096
01:11:44,460 --> 01:11:45,340
Yeah.

1097
01:11:45,340 --> 01:11:52,100
My theory is the Middle Ages ended around 2100.

1098
01:11:52,100 --> 01:11:54,380
After the Middle Ages ended, they'll say,

1099
01:11:54,380 --> 01:11:56,620
those guys back in the 21st century,

1100
01:11:56,620 --> 01:11:58,820
they had no idea how thinking worked.

1101
01:11:58,820 --> 01:12:01,100
They couldn't even think of a few ways to think.

1102
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:04,580
They had poverty.

1103
01:12:04,580 --> 01:12:06,140
They had wars.

1104
01:12:06,140 --> 01:12:09,340
Those guys were barely out of their mind class.

1105
01:12:09,340 --> 01:12:12,220
Right.

1106
01:12:12,220 --> 01:12:13,940
I just read a history of AI.

1107
01:12:13,940 --> 01:12:16,140
I forget who wrote it.

1108
01:12:16,140 --> 01:12:22,780
But it had this section saying, it mentioned the Newell Simon.

1109
01:12:22,780 --> 01:12:24,860
There was a thing called general problem solver,

1110
01:12:24,860 --> 01:12:27,780
which I mentioned a couple of times in the book.

1111
01:12:27,780 --> 01:12:33,540
And it's the idea that the way to solve a problem is to find

1112
01:12:33,540 --> 01:12:35,340
it's a symbolic servo.

1113
01:12:35,340 --> 01:12:38,940
Find the difference between what you have and what you want,

1114
01:12:38,940 --> 01:12:41,260
and look in your memory for something

1115
01:12:41,260 --> 01:12:43,260
that can reduce that difference.

1116
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:44,100
Keep doing that.

1117
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:47,080
And of course, it's important to pay attention

1118
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:52,020
to the more important differences first and so forth.

1119
01:12:52,020 --> 01:12:55,460
And I'll send you this article.

1120
01:12:55,460 --> 01:12:59,780
This article is saying that they made a terrible mistake,

1121
01:12:59,780 --> 01:13:01,940
and this was a trivial theory.

1122
01:13:01,940 --> 01:13:04,580
And that's why nobody uses it anymore.

1123
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:07,620
And it was interesting how many AI people fell

1124
01:13:07,620 --> 01:13:11,660
for that idea in the 1960s.

1125
01:13:11,660 --> 01:13:16,180
My complaint has been that if you look in a modern textbook

1126
01:13:16,180 --> 01:13:24,500
on, you must have some in your first volume, Pat.

1127
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:26,220
Didn't you have some GPS things?

1128
01:13:31,300 --> 01:13:32,940
If you want to keep up with AI, you

1129
01:13:32,940 --> 01:13:36,940
should read Patrick's textbook, even though people

1130
01:13:36,940 --> 01:13:39,380
are starting to use this new one, which

1131
01:13:39,380 --> 01:13:41,020
doesn't have any AI in it.

1132
01:13:44,220 --> 01:13:45,660
Who's it by?

1133
01:13:45,660 --> 01:13:46,620
AUDIENCE MEMBER 2, AUDIENCE MEMBER 3,

1134
01:13:46,620 --> 01:13:47,540
Russell and Norvig.

1135
01:13:47,540 --> 01:13:48,980
Russell and Norvig.

1136
01:13:48,980 --> 01:13:51,620
It's probably pretty good, technically.

1137
01:13:51,620 --> 01:13:54,860
But I leafed through it, and it didn't have any.

1138
01:13:54,860 --> 01:13:57,340
Never mind.

1139
01:13:57,340 --> 01:13:59,820
It's probably better than I think, because I'm jealous.

1140
01:14:10,620 --> 01:14:12,620
Yes.

1141
01:14:13,620 --> 01:14:15,100
Kind of a different topic.

1142
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:17,100
In Society of Mind, you were talking

1143
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:20,580
about the amnesia of infancy when you forget what you learned

1144
01:14:20,580 --> 01:14:23,580
and things that were once difficult become common sense,

1145
01:14:23,580 --> 01:14:26,580
and you can't even remember how it was different then.

1146
01:14:26,580 --> 01:14:28,580
So it's just been wondering about the reverse

1147
01:14:28,580 --> 01:14:30,580
of that process, when you try and say,

1148
01:14:30,580 --> 01:14:33,060
teach something to somebody that you internalize as people,

1149
01:14:33,060 --> 01:14:37,060
that you're quick to understand and bringing back up

1150
01:14:37,060 --> 01:14:38,540
the different levels.

1151
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:42,020
I'm not exactly sure if there's a question to it.

1152
01:14:42,020 --> 01:14:45,020
It's just kind of quite fun, and wondering about,

1153
01:14:45,020 --> 01:14:49,460
is that itself another way of re-learning the things

1154
01:14:49,460 --> 01:14:52,780
that you learned?

1155
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:54,180
That's sure an interesting question.

1156
01:14:57,020 --> 01:15:03,500
When I first learned about programming,

1157
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:08,420
I had the idea that maybe babies think in machine language,

1158
01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:15,260
and then after a while, they start to think in Fortran.

1159
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:17,860
And then finally, when they're a little older,

1160
01:15:17,860 --> 01:15:20,100
they think in Algol or something.

1161
01:15:23,580 --> 01:15:26,820
But when they switch from machine language to Fortran,

1162
01:15:26,820 --> 01:15:30,540
then they can't remember their earlier thoughts.

1163
01:15:30,540 --> 01:15:37,020
And there's almost no evidence of people

1164
01:15:37,020 --> 01:15:43,540
finding genuine recollections from two-year-olds

1165
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:46,140
at later ages.

1166
01:15:46,140 --> 01:15:49,180
Now, almost everybody thinks they remember something,

1167
01:15:49,180 --> 01:15:52,820
but there's the problem that you might have rehearsed it

1168
01:15:52,820 --> 01:15:55,820
and translated it into the Fortran, and the Algol,

1169
01:15:55,820 --> 01:16:03,260
and the Lisp, and the logo, whatever it is.

1170
01:16:03,740 --> 01:16:11,140
One of my greatest influences was a great mathematician

1171
01:16:11,140 --> 01:16:15,500
named Andrew Gleason at Harvard, who I met practically

1172
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:20,100
the first day I got to Harvard.

1173
01:16:20,100 --> 01:16:24,620
And he would always talk about things I didn't understand,

1174
01:16:24,620 --> 01:16:28,340
and I would go home and look them up and try to.

1175
01:16:28,340 --> 01:16:34,060
Anyway, one day, we were talking about number forms.

1176
01:16:34,060 --> 01:16:38,060
And number forms are a psychological phenomenon

1177
01:16:38,060 --> 01:16:44,620
which about 30% of people have, and it was first

1178
01:16:44,620 --> 01:16:48,540
described by Francis Galton.

1179
01:16:48,540 --> 01:16:58,020
And the phenomenon is, if I ask you, close your eyes

1180
01:16:58,020 --> 01:17:04,900
and tell me where is the number 3, how many of you

1181
01:17:04,900 --> 01:17:08,140
have a place for the number 3?

1182
01:17:08,140 --> 01:17:09,900
Well, that's a few.

1183
01:17:09,900 --> 01:17:16,940
And so typically, if you imagine the visual field,

1184
01:17:16,940 --> 01:17:20,220
it's a windshield, I guess.

1185
01:17:20,220 --> 01:17:23,860
So there are these numbers, and they're

1186
01:17:23,860 --> 01:17:34,340
nowhere in particular, except that it's usually

1187
01:17:34,340 --> 01:17:39,100
like that for an older child.

1188
01:17:39,100 --> 01:17:41,860
So here are these numbers.

1189
01:17:41,860 --> 01:17:47,580
And what's more, in some people, they're colored.

1190
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:48,940
So I was talking to Andrew.

1191
01:17:48,940 --> 01:17:51,860
I had read this Galton paper, which

1192
01:17:51,860 --> 01:17:56,620
is 1890 or 1885 or something.

1193
01:17:56,620 --> 01:18:00,460
And so I was asking people if they had number forms.

1194
01:18:00,460 --> 01:18:03,620
And he said, oh, yes, he has one.

1195
01:18:03,620 --> 01:18:09,060
And he sketched it for me.

1196
01:18:09,060 --> 01:18:12,780
And he said, and they're colored, too.

1197
01:18:12,780 --> 01:18:15,180
Oh, and his went way up.

1198
01:18:15,180 --> 01:18:16,860
And the prime numbers were bright.

1199
01:18:16,860 --> 01:18:22,460
What am I doing?

1200
01:18:22,460 --> 01:18:28,740
Maybe the composite numbers were something was bright,

1201
01:18:28,740 --> 01:18:29,660
and they were colored.

1202
01:18:32,420 --> 01:18:38,100
So I wrote this down, and over the next couple of years,

1203
01:18:38,100 --> 01:18:42,620
I look in antique stores for old children's blocks,

1204
01:18:42,620 --> 01:18:44,980
and I found a set of blocks that matched that.

1205
01:18:47,860 --> 01:18:52,980
And Andrew Gleason said that he knows

1206
01:18:52,980 --> 01:18:55,820
when he acquired this thing.

1207
01:18:55,820 --> 01:18:58,140
And it was about four years old.

1208
01:18:58,140 --> 01:19:07,300
And he had a window in his house, and there was a hill.

1209
01:19:07,300 --> 01:19:11,060
And he could just see over the sill,

1210
01:19:11,060 --> 01:19:14,060
and he imagined these numbers on the side of that hill.

1211
01:19:14,060 --> 01:19:15,420
Blah, blah, blah.

1212
01:19:15,420 --> 01:19:20,580
Anyway, people who don't have a number form

1213
01:19:20,580 --> 01:19:24,900
don't know what I'm talking about.

1214
01:19:24,900 --> 01:19:27,300
And I don't know if the 30% is still true,

1215
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:31,100
but it's an interesting phenomenon.

1216
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:37,420
And in most cases of early childhood,

1217
01:19:37,420 --> 01:19:41,300
you can't find out because children do remember

1218
01:19:41,300 --> 01:19:43,580
details of a house they lived in,

1219
01:19:43,580 --> 01:19:47,940
but you don't know if they've copied it.

1220
01:19:47,940 --> 01:19:49,740
So what was the original question?

1221
01:19:53,180 --> 01:19:57,580
How much can you remember from infancy?

1222
01:19:57,580 --> 01:19:59,740
L. Rand Hubbard thought you could go back

1223
01:19:59,740 --> 01:20:04,060
to before you were born, and you could

1224
01:20:04,060 --> 01:20:07,100
remember people talking about you

1225
01:20:07,100 --> 01:20:08,380
when you're still in the womb.

1226
01:20:13,980 --> 01:20:17,580
So anyway, John Campbell said you should look into this.

1227
01:20:17,580 --> 01:20:21,940
And a few of us made an expedition.

1228
01:20:21,940 --> 01:20:24,820
We went down to Elizabeth, New Jersey

1229
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:29,540
to visit the just starting up Dianetics Center.

1230
01:20:29,540 --> 01:20:34,500
And I met this L. Rand Hubbard, who had green eyes

1231
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:39,420
and was quite hypnotic looking.

1232
01:20:39,420 --> 01:20:42,740
And the end of the story is he had

1233
01:20:42,740 --> 01:20:45,180
been writing about how if you took

1234
01:20:45,180 --> 01:20:47,700
this treatment of Dianetics, then you

1235
01:20:47,700 --> 01:20:51,420
could memorize an entire newspaper in five minutes

1236
01:20:51,420 --> 01:20:54,580
and do all sorts of miraculous things like that

1237
01:20:54,580 --> 01:20:59,700
once your mind has been cleared of aberrations and obstacles.

1238
01:20:59,700 --> 01:21:05,020
And it became a big industry and turned into later Scientology.

1239
01:21:05,020 --> 01:21:07,780
I'm sure you've all heard about that.

1240
01:21:07,780 --> 01:21:12,540
So we asked Hubbard to look at a newspaper

1241
01:21:12,540 --> 01:21:14,500
and tell us what was in it.

1242
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:18,080
And he explained he was so busy training the other people

1243
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:20,540
to be cleared that he hadn't had time

1244
01:21:20,540 --> 01:21:27,580
to go through the procedure himself.

1245
01:21:27,580 --> 01:21:28,820
And I never saw him again.

1246
01:21:33,540 --> 01:21:34,980
Yes?

1247
01:21:34,980 --> 01:21:38,220
What are your thoughts on memes and the fact

1248
01:21:38,220 --> 01:21:41,500
that we're just replicas or our thoughts are actually

1249
01:21:41,500 --> 01:21:45,420
all replicas of something different?

1250
01:21:45,420 --> 01:21:46,900
Of memes?

1251
01:21:46,900 --> 01:21:49,940
Just using the blackboard.

1252
01:21:49,940 --> 01:21:50,820
You mean Dawkins?

1253
01:21:54,220 --> 01:21:56,780
I didn't quite get the whole question.

1254
01:21:56,780 --> 01:21:59,900
The idea that, uh.

1255
01:21:59,900 --> 01:22:03,740
Oh, so memes, so for example, the way we talk

1256
01:22:03,740 --> 01:22:07,300
and the way we all talk, how we very much

1257
01:22:07,300 --> 01:22:12,180
remix the way our parents talked for people around us

1258
01:22:12,180 --> 01:22:15,300
and possibly the way we think as well.

1259
01:22:15,300 --> 01:22:19,500
So how does that relate to how our mind develops?

1260
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:23,020
Or are we actually creative original characters?

1261
01:22:23,020 --> 01:22:24,340
Or are we not at all?

1262
01:22:24,340 --> 01:22:27,540
Well, of course, it's both because you learn things

1263
01:22:27,540 --> 01:22:28,500
from your culture.

1264
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:34,060
And then you might just mainly repeat things,

1265
01:22:34,060 --> 01:22:39,140
or you might get the knack of making new ideas.

1266
01:22:39,140 --> 01:22:42,420
I'm trying to remember what Dawkins' main ideas are.

1267
01:22:46,540 --> 01:22:56,860
He invented the word meme to say that the ideas that people have

1268
01:22:56,860 --> 01:23:00,520
might be considered to be somewhat similar to the genes

1269
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:03,500
in our heredity, and that societies

1270
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:07,180
are systems in which these memes, which

1271
01:23:07,180 --> 01:23:13,620
are conceptual units of meaning or knowledge,

1272
01:23:13,620 --> 01:23:17,340
propagate around and self-reproduce and mutate

1273
01:23:17,340 --> 01:23:20,180
and spread.

1274
01:23:20,180 --> 01:23:25,700
And I don't know what to say about it,

1275
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:30,300
except that it's obviously true that every now and then

1276
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:33,420
someone gets a new idea and tells people,

1277
01:23:33,420 --> 01:23:36,100
and for one reason or another, they either forget it

1278
01:23:36,100 --> 01:23:38,400
or tell someone else.

1279
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:42,100
And after a while, it spreads, and some of them

1280
01:23:42,100 --> 01:23:44,620
fill up the whole culture, and some just die out.

1281
01:23:48,860 --> 01:23:52,640
And whatever else Dawkins says, he's a very smart guy,

1282
01:23:52,640 --> 01:23:56,480
but almost everything, then, in my mind,

1283
01:23:56,480 --> 01:24:00,280
is that he's explaining that religions are mostly

1284
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:03,560
made of these memes, and they're very bad

1285
01:24:03,560 --> 01:24:11,400
and cost the world a great deal in progress and productivity.

1286
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:14,840
In other words, he's a militant atheist,

1287
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:21,480
and there are about five best sellers in that business today.

1288
01:24:21,480 --> 01:24:23,820
But I don't know what else to say about memes.

1289
01:24:23,820 --> 01:24:27,960
It's an obviously generally correct idea.

1290
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:34,460
But the great thing about genes is

1291
01:24:34,460 --> 01:24:38,880
we know the four amino acids or four nucleic acids

1292
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:44,160
they're made of and how they're roped together and all that.

1293
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:51,080
And I don't think Dawkins' theory develops anywhere nearly

1294
01:24:51,080 --> 01:24:53,720
as elegantly as modern genetics.

1295
01:24:53,720 --> 01:25:02,120
So it would be nice if it could, but a really good theory

1296
01:25:02,120 --> 01:25:06,240
of good ideas would be nice to have.

1297
01:25:06,240 --> 01:25:11,140
What would it look like?

1298
01:25:11,140 --> 01:25:14,120
Someday, we'll have an AI that just punches them out.

1299
01:25:14,120 --> 01:25:16,480
I think it would include a really good language.

1300
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:21,280
Oh, right.

1301
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:24,240
Robert Heinlein has some stories in which

1302
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:28,920
the super-intelligent people have a language that's

1303
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:32,320
so dense that in five syllables, they

1304
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:36,040
can explain something that would take you a half hour.

1305
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:39,320
I think I forget what it's log land.

1306
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,920
Maybe.

1307
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:45,600
Anyway, if you need a good idea, read Robert Heinlein.

1308
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:50,780
Sure.

1309
01:25:50,780 --> 01:25:53,280
I forgot where you mentioned this,

1310
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:56,280
where you talked about how geniuses,

1311
01:25:56,280 --> 01:26:01,400
they might have just come up with better ways

1312
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:08,960
to think better, better ways to learn.

1313
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:09,460
Yes.

1314
01:26:09,460 --> 01:26:13,960
About how to better meta-meta learning.

1315
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:18,440
But why do you think they never learned that?

1316
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:23,960
And why hasn't they propagated that method

1317
01:26:23,960 --> 01:26:28,200
of better learning about how better to learn?

1318
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:30,360
That's a great question.

1319
01:26:30,360 --> 01:26:38,240
And do you think it's just we don't

1320
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:46,400
have a concept of an idea that improves better learning?

1321
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:52,680
There's a couple of phenomena that,

1322
01:26:52,680 --> 01:26:55,520
how come there were so many geniuses in Athens?

1323
01:26:58,440 --> 01:27:02,780
And then some of the best mathematicians

1324
01:27:02,780 --> 01:27:11,460
came from some high school in some little country

1325
01:27:11,460 --> 01:27:12,260
next to the Baltic.

1326
01:27:14,980 --> 01:27:16,740
Bulgaria?

1327
01:27:16,740 --> 01:27:18,340
Romania.

1328
01:27:18,340 --> 01:27:21,500
Yes, there was some high school in Romania

1329
01:27:21,500 --> 01:27:24,060
that not only produced von Neumann,

1330
01:27:24,060 --> 01:27:27,700
but about five or six other world class mathematicians.

1331
01:27:27,700 --> 01:27:29,860
I don't remember the details.

1332
01:27:29,860 --> 01:27:30,900
So that's a nice question.

1333
01:27:30,900 --> 01:27:37,700
How come if there are these great memes,

1334
01:27:37,700 --> 01:27:41,940
how come there aren't more big pockets of them?

1335
01:27:41,940 --> 01:27:45,220
But there are a lot of cultures which were very inventive

1336
01:27:45,220 --> 01:27:47,180
in other than intellectual fields.

1337
01:27:50,500 --> 01:27:53,580
How come Paris got all those artists in the?

1338
01:27:53,580 --> 01:27:56,620
How many of you saw the Woody Allen movie?

1339
01:27:56,620 --> 01:27:57,860
What's it called?

1340
01:27:57,860 --> 01:27:58,900
Paris at Midnight?

1341
01:28:02,900 --> 01:28:03,620
So funny.

1342
01:28:09,020 --> 01:28:12,300
Like, if you're able to take on one,

1343
01:28:12,300 --> 01:28:20,140
then one idea that will improve your improvement of your life.

1344
01:28:20,140 --> 01:28:22,860
Right.

1345
01:28:22,860 --> 01:28:25,140
That's a good question for each of us.

1346
01:28:25,140 --> 01:28:27,100
What's your very best idea?

1347
01:28:27,100 --> 01:28:30,300
And stop fussing with the other ones and get that one out.

1348
01:28:35,820 --> 01:28:37,940
There must be some people who are very quiet

1349
01:28:37,940 --> 01:28:41,380
and only speak once in a long time.

1350
01:28:41,380 --> 01:28:44,740
We should watch them carefully.

1351
01:28:44,740 --> 01:28:45,500
Yes?

1352
01:28:45,500 --> 01:28:47,500
I guess along with mine, do you ever

1353
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:50,940
feel restricted by language because everybody didn't have it?

1354
01:28:50,940 --> 01:28:51,440
Wait.

1355
01:28:56,020 --> 01:28:58,060
It's the sound.

1356
01:28:58,060 --> 01:28:58,780
I can't hear it.

1357
01:29:02,780 --> 01:29:04,340
Is that strong enough to lift you?

1358
01:29:10,460 --> 01:29:13,380
I'm sure someone's done it.

1359
01:29:13,380 --> 01:29:15,780
Sorry about that.

1360
01:29:15,780 --> 01:29:18,540
Do you ever feel restricted by language

1361
01:29:18,540 --> 01:29:22,980
and that you must represent your theory of mind

1362
01:29:23,060 --> 01:29:27,300
or any theory or idea with language?

1363
01:29:27,300 --> 01:29:28,100
No, I don't.

1364
01:29:28,100 --> 01:29:33,380
But I once was jealous when Papert explained

1365
01:29:33,380 --> 01:29:36,540
that he got some idea.

1366
01:29:36,540 --> 01:29:39,180
And he explained he gets ideas like that

1367
01:29:39,180 --> 01:29:40,260
when he thinks in French.

1368
01:29:42,260 --> 01:29:45,100
Well, you draw pictures, too.

1369
01:29:45,100 --> 01:29:45,780
What?

1370
01:29:45,780 --> 01:29:47,260
You draw pictures, too.

1371
01:29:47,260 --> 01:29:47,860
Oh, yeah.

1372
01:29:47,860 --> 01:29:49,180
So it's not just language.

1373
01:29:49,180 --> 01:29:51,140
That's a language.

1374
01:29:51,140 --> 01:29:54,060
Graphics.

1375
01:29:54,060 --> 01:29:58,820
So we ought to have devices within the next few years

1376
01:29:58,820 --> 01:30:02,420
that draw pictures when you think.

1377
01:30:06,140 --> 01:30:08,740
It's so funny.

1378
01:30:08,740 --> 01:30:11,500
We had cyborgs.

1379
01:30:11,500 --> 01:30:13,180
What were they called?

1380
01:30:13,180 --> 01:30:14,460
I mentioned them last time.

1381
01:30:14,460 --> 01:30:16,500
We had Steve Mann.

1382
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:18,820
And who's the other one?

1383
01:30:19,580 --> 01:30:22,500
Yeah.

1384
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:25,500
So there's these two guys around the Media Lab

1385
01:30:25,500 --> 01:30:29,420
wearing various things on their head.

1386
01:30:29,420 --> 01:30:30,540
And they're always typing.

1387
01:30:30,540 --> 01:30:34,140
And you ask them a question, and they've searched Google.

1388
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:41,100
When was that?

1389
01:30:41,100 --> 01:30:43,600
1990?

1390
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:46,580
1995, I think.

1391
01:30:46,580 --> 01:30:48,060
But it's all gone.

1392
01:30:48,060 --> 01:30:52,060
Nobody walks around with direct connection to the web.

1393
01:30:52,060 --> 01:30:53,980
Well, Steve Mann's still best.

1394
01:30:53,980 --> 01:30:56,540
Yes.

1395
01:30:56,540 --> 01:30:59,380
Anyway, I certainly expected it to turn up,

1396
01:30:59,380 --> 01:31:02,580
and something wrong.

1397
01:31:02,580 --> 01:31:06,660
So anyway, you should be able to buy one one of these days.

1398
01:31:06,660 --> 01:31:08,180
And what's your name?

1399
01:31:10,780 --> 01:31:14,340
Who was that nice woman who had the EEG thing?

1400
01:31:14,340 --> 01:31:18,540
Do you remember at TED?

1401
01:31:22,140 --> 01:31:23,100
Forgot her name.

1402
01:31:23,100 --> 01:31:24,900
Anyway, she had this sort of helmet

1403
01:31:24,900 --> 01:31:27,660
which had about 20 electrodes.

1404
01:31:27,660 --> 01:31:33,060
And she induced me to put it on a stage

1405
01:31:33,060 --> 01:31:37,340
with about 1,000 people there, which was rather funny.

1406
01:31:37,340 --> 01:31:40,500
And there's a little spot on the CRT.

1407
01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:45,460
And I get to think about it moving one way or the other

1408
01:31:45,460 --> 01:31:49,620
and rewarding it when it did the right thing for only about half

1409
01:31:49,620 --> 01:31:50,620
a minute.

1410
01:31:50,620 --> 01:31:52,940
And then I could steer it around.

1411
01:31:52,940 --> 01:31:56,700
So here was a nice primitive gadget

1412
01:31:56,700 --> 01:32:00,580
where you could sort of almost draw just by thinking

1413
01:32:00,580 --> 01:32:02,420
this spot.

1414
01:32:02,420 -
[01:40:43.540 --> 01:40:50.540]  should we bomb China or not, you could get 100 million people
[01:40:50.540 --> 01:40:54.380]  to run up to the keyboard and say yes or no.
[01:40:54.380 --> 01:41:00.660]  And presumably when the, what do they
[01:41:00.660 --> 01:41:04.660]  call that great crowd of Jeffersons and Franklins
[01:41:04.660 --> 01:41:12.140]  and the Founding Fathers, did a lot of things to prevent that.
[01:41:12.140 --> 01:41:15.100]  And the one that they focused on,
[01:41:15.100 --> 01:41:17.320]  which was one of the most effective,
[01:41:17.320 --> 01:41:20.340]  was called the Electoral College.
[01:41:20.340 --> 01:41:23.380]  And the United States is different from other places
[01:41:23.380 --> 01:41:27.700]  because we don't elect congressmen or presidents.
[01:41:27.700 --> 01:41:30.780]  We elect smart people from the community
[01:41:30.780 --> 01:41:35.540]  who then get together and decide who should be president.
[01:41:35.540 --> 01:41:39.420]  And of course, now if anybody, now they belong to parties.
[01:41:39.420 --> 01:41:43.980]  And if any of them voted for the other party's candidate,
[01:41:43.980 --> 01:41:46.100]  they would be held to pay.
[01:41:46.100 --> 01:41:51.020]  But it was a great idea because the Founding Fathers realized
[01:41:51.020 --> 01:41:53.320]  that if you had instant feedback, which
[01:41:53.600 --> 01:41:58.520]  Hitler got, then you could say something really exciting
[01:41:58.520 --> 01:42:01.400]  and everybody would press the yes button.
[01:42:01.400 --> 01:42:03.280]  And then you kill all the Jews.
[01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:07.300]  And then the next speech, you kill all the black people
[01:42:07.300 --> 01:42:10.120]  and all the yellow people and all the people
[01:42:10.120 --> 01:42:14.760]  whose last name doesn't begin with M.
[01:42:14.760 --> 01:42:19.360]  And so what you don't want is instant feedback.
[01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:23.960]  Now, the new social networks are getting us close to that.
[01:42:23.960 --> 01:42:29.760]  And the question is, is it time to have,
[01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:32.320]  is it time to stop that?
[01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:33.920]  Is it getting dangerous?
[01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:35.320]  I don't know.
[01:42:35.320 --> 01:42:37.560]  But there must be a lot of people
[01:42:37.560 --> 01:42:42.400]  who are recognizing that this thing is creeping up on us.
[01:42:42.400 --> 01:42:47.120]  And you might be able to get 50 million people to do something
[01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:51.680]  reckless in a few minutes if you don't put some limits.
[01:42:54.280 --> 01:42:57.280]  I don't think we could get the electoral college back
[01:42:57.280 --> 01:43:02.960]  because you'd have to get a majority to.
[01:43:02.960 --> 01:43:05.560]  What does it take to fix the Constitution?
[01:43:05.560 --> 01:43:06.240]  2 thirds?
[01:43:10.600 --> 01:43:14.400]  We'll never see 2 thirds again.
[01:43:14.400 --> 01:43:15.400]  It's the end of America.
[01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:20.800]  Well, we have three minutes.
[01:43:26.960 --> 01:43:28.160]  Yes?
[01:43:28.160 --> 01:43:31.960]  If you design a direction for the field of psychology,
[01:43:31.960 --> 01:43:34.760]  obviously one where there's a set of debunking tools,
[01:43:34.760 --> 01:43:36.520]  what would you say they should be doing?
[01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:44.320]  They should read Patrick Winston's thesis.
[01:43:44.320 --> 01:43:48.840]  The psychologists now have disappeared
[01:43:48.840 --> 01:43:51.920]  into the tar pit of statistics.
[01:43:51.920 --> 01:43:54.240]  And they don't have the idea that knowledge needs
[01:43:54.240 --> 01:43:57.520]  complicated representations.
[01:43:57.520 --> 01:44:03.040]  And I don't care whether you assign probabilities to them
[01:44:03.040 --> 01:44:05.960]  or put them in the order in which you thought of them
[01:44:05.960 --> 01:44:12.040]  or do what Doug Lennett did in his thesis of swapping things
[01:44:12.040 --> 01:44:14.600]  when one worked better than another.
[01:44:14.600 --> 01:44:20.640]  But I forget the question.
[01:44:20.640 --> 01:44:25.040]  But I think we've got to get better ideas
[01:44:25.040 --> 01:44:26.920]  about representation of knowledge.
[01:44:26.920 --> 01:44:29.760]  And I don't know where they're going to come from now
[01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:34.640]  that the whole AI community is drifting
[01:44:34.640 --> 01:44:42.760]  into these ways of avoiding representations.
[01:44:42.760 --> 01:44:49.480]  I haven't read the Norvig Russell book, so does he?
[01:44:49.480 --> 01:44:52.040]  Can anybody summarize what it says about knowledge
[01:44:52.040 --> 01:44:52.920]  representation?
[01:44:56.160 --> 01:44:56.880]  Who's read it?
[01:44:59.560 --> 01:45:00.080]  Was it?
[01:45:00.080 --> 01:45:04.560]  There's a chapter on logic, first order logic.
[01:45:04.560 --> 01:45:07.040]  That's so funny.
[01:45:07.040 --> 01:45:10.320]  First order of logic is what Newell and Simon thought
[01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:18.600]  of in 1956 before they thought of the so-called GPS thing.
[01:45:21.120 --> 01:45:23.480]  Logic can't make analogies.
[01:45:23.480 --> 01:45:29.520]  It's a very bad thing to get stuck with.
[01:45:29.520 --> 01:45:30.520]  0 or 1?
[01:45:39.040 --> 01:45:42.160]  Maybe one of our papers should be on what
[01:45:42.160 --> 01:45:43.680]  should AI do next year?
[01:45:46.880 --> 01:45:48.000]  9 o'clock.
[01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:48.800]  Thanks for coming.
[01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:50.360]  Thank you.

and who's the copy.

1492
01:38:00,540 --> 01:38:04,180
Frederick Pohl wrote a similar story much longer ago

1493
01:38:04,180 --> 01:38:12,020
where people are copied and the copy is sent on a one-way trip

1494
01:38:12,020 --> 01:38:15,100
to some planet to fix a broken reactor.

1495
01:38:15,100 --> 01:38:20,540
And they always die, and you get a million dollars

1496
01:38:20,540 --> 01:38:22,780
for providing this copy.

1497
01:38:22,780 --> 01:38:28,620
But one of the copies survived, so it's the same plot.

1498
01:38:28,620 --> 01:38:31,940
I can't remember the.

1499
01:38:31,940 --> 01:38:35,540
If you're looking for a good idea,

1500
01:38:35,540 --> 01:38:39,060
if you go to 1950s science fiction,

1501
01:38:39,060 --> 01:38:42,300
look for A.E. van Vogt or Frederick

1502
01:38:42,300 --> 01:38:48,020
Pohl or all those wonderful writers,

1503
01:38:48,020 --> 01:38:52,100
that was before it was necessary to describe really good

1504
01:38:52,100 --> 01:38:53,740
characters.

1505
01:38:53,740 --> 01:38:56,860
And science fiction got better and better

1506
01:38:56,860 --> 01:39:00,620
for the literary critics and generally worse and worse

1507
01:39:00,620 --> 01:39:03,900
for the science fiction fans.

1508
01:39:09,820 --> 01:39:12,780
Do we really have any more questions?

1509
01:39:12,780 --> 01:39:13,860
Yes.

1510
01:39:13,860 --> 01:39:18,020
So we're in a time age where sharing information

1511
01:39:18,020 --> 01:39:22,340
between many people on a short amount of time

1512
01:39:22,340 --> 01:39:25,060
is quite easy to internet and anything like this.

1513
01:39:25,060 --> 01:39:27,860
Do you think that this will change?

1514
01:39:27,860 --> 01:39:29,980
This will bring up many more ideas?

1515
01:39:29,980 --> 01:39:31,300
Do you think that this will hinder?

1516
01:39:31,300 --> 01:39:37,300
Because before this time, people had problems

1517
01:39:37,300 --> 01:39:39,060
with sharing the information.

1518
01:39:39,060 --> 01:39:43,460
And also now it's not easy to have a large group of people

1519
01:39:43,460 --> 01:39:45,060
working on one thing.

1520
01:39:45,060 --> 01:39:48,180
Do you think that this will change the way that we think?

1521
01:39:48,180 --> 01:39:51,260
And do you think that this will make us better?

1522
01:39:51,260 --> 01:39:53,660
It's a tough one.

1523
01:39:53,660 --> 01:39:56,940
Bad things can happen, and good things can happen.

1524
01:40:02,940 --> 01:40:04,820
That's funny, because that reminds me again

1525
01:40:04,820 --> 01:40:09,260
of science fiction, because in science fiction, many, many

1526
01:40:09,260 --> 01:40:12,940
years ago, some writers got the idea

1527
01:40:12,940 --> 01:40:16,260
that there would be something like an internet.

1528
01:40:16,260 --> 01:40:19,900
And some people realized there would be flash crowds.

1529
01:40:19,900 --> 01:40:23,100
And now there are flash crowds.

1530
01:40:23,100 --> 01:40:30,500
And I remember even as a kid talking to people who said,

1531
01:40:30,500 --> 01:40:33,340
why not wire up the voting machines

1532
01:40:33,340 --> 01:40:36,180
so that they're always there?

1533
01:40:36,180 --> 01:40:38,140
And so if somebody in the government

1534
01:40:38,140 --> 01:40:43,540
wants to know, should we do this or that,

1535
01:40:43,540 --> 01:40:50,540
should we bomb China or not, you could get 100 million people

1536
01:40:50,540 --> 01:40:54,380
to run up to the keyboard and say yes or no.

1537
01:40:54,380 --> 01:41:00,660
And presumably when the, what do they

1538
01:41:00,660 --> 01:41:04,660
call that great crowd of Jeffersons and Franklins

1539
01:41:04,660 --> 01:41:12,140
and the Founding Fathers, did a lot of things to prevent that.

1540
01:41:12,140 --> 01:41:15,100
And the one that they focused on,

1541
01:41:15,100 --> 01:41:17,320
which was one of the most effective,

1542
01:41:17,320 --> 01:41:20,340
was called the Electoral College.

1543
01:41:20,340 --> 01:41:23,380
And the United States is different from other places

1544
01:41:23,380 --> 01:41:27,700
because we don't elect congressmen or presidents.

1545
01:41:27,700 --> 01:41:30,780
We elect smart people from the community

1546
01:41:30,780 --> 01:41:35,540
who then get together and decide who should be president.

1547
01:41:35,540 --> 01:41:39,420
And of course, now if anybody, now they belong to parties.

1548
01:41:39,420 --> 01:41:43,980
And if any of them voted for the other party's candidate,

1549
01:41:43,980 --> 01:41:46,100
they would be held to pay.

1550
01:41:46,100 --> 01:41:51,020
But it was a great idea because the Founding Fathers realized

1551
01:41:51,020 --> 01:41:53,320
that if you had instant feedback, which

1552
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:58,520
Hitler got, then you could say something really exciting

1553
01:41:58,520 --> 01:42:01,400
and everybody would press the yes button.

1554
01:42:01,400 --> 01:42:03,280
And then you kill all the Jews.

1555
01:42:03,280 --> 01:42:07,300
And then the next speech, you kill all the black people

1556
01:42:07,300 --> 01:42:10,120
and all the yellow people and all the people

1557
01:42:10,120 --> 01:42:14,760
whose last name doesn't begin with M.

1558
01:42:14,760 --> 01:42:19,360
And so what you don't want is instant feedback.

1559
01:42:19,360 --> 01:42:23,960
Now, the new social networks are getting us close to that.

1560
01:42:23,960 --> 01:42:29,760
And the question is, is it time to have,

1561
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:32,320
is it time to stop that?

1562
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:33,920
Is it getting dangerous?

1563
01:42:33,920 --> 01:42:35,320
I don't know.

1564
01:42:35,320 --> 01:42:37,560
But there must be a lot of people

1565
01:42:37,560 --> 01:42:42,400
who are recognizing that this thing is creeping up on us.

1566
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:47,120
And you might be able to get 50 million people to do something

1567
01:42:47,120 --> 01:42:51,680
reckless in a few minutes if you don't put some limits.

1568
01:42:54,280 --> 01:42:57,280
I don't think we could get the electoral college back

1569
01:42:57,280 --> 01:43:02,960
because you'd have to get a majority to.

1570
01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:05,560
What does it take to fix the Constitution?

1571
01:43:05,560 --> 01:43:06,240
2 thirds?

1572
01:43:10,600 --> 01:43:14,400
We'll never see 2 thirds again.

1573
01:43:14,400 --> 01:43:15,400
It's the end of America.

1574
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:20,800
Well, we have three minutes.

1575
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:28,160
Yes?

1576
01:43:28,160 --> 01:43:31,960
If you design a direction for the field of psychology,

1577
01:43:31,960 --> 01:43:34,760
obviously one where there's a set of debunking tools,

1578
01:43:34,760 --> 01:43:36,520
what would you say they should be doing?

1579
01:43:39,880 --> 01:43:44,320
They should read Patrick Winston's thesis.

1580
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:48,840
The psychologists now have disappeared

1581
01:43:48,840 --> 01:43:51,920
into the tar pit of statistics.

1582
01:43:51,920 --> 01:43:54,240
And they don't have the idea that knowledge needs

1583
01:43:54,240 --> 01:43:57,520
complicated representations.

1584
01:43:57,520 --> 01:44:03,040
And I don't care whether you assign probabilities to them

1585
01:44:03,040 --> 01:44:05,960
or put them in the order in which you thought of them

1586
01:44:05,960 --> 01:44:12,040
or do what Doug Lennett did in his thesis of swapping things

1587
01:44:12,040 --> 01:44:14,600
when one worked better than another.

1588
01:44:14,600 --> 01:44:20,640
But I forget the question.

1589
01:44:20,640 --> 01:44:25,040
But I think we've got to get better ideas

1590
01:44:25,040 --> 01:44:26,920
about representation of knowledge.

1591
01:44:26,920 --> 01:44:29,760
And I don't know where they're going to come from now

1592
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:34,640
that the whole AI community is drifting

1593
01:44:34,640 --> 01:44:42,760
into these ways of avoiding representations.

1594
01:44:42,760 --> 01:44:49,480
I haven't read the Norvig Russell book, so does he?

1595
01:44:49,480 --> 01:44:52,040
Can anybody summarize what it says about knowledge

1596
01:44:52,040 --> 01:44:52,920
representation?

1597
01:44:56,160 --> 01:44:56,880
Who's read it?

1598
01:44:59,560 --> 01:45:00,080
Was it?

1599
01:45:00,080 --> 01:45:04,560
There's a chapter on logic, first order logic.

1600
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:07,040
That's so funny.

1601
01:45:07,040 --> 01:45:10,320
First order of logic is what Newell and Simon thought

1602
01:45:10,320 --> 01:45:18,600
of in 1956 before they thought of the so-called GPS thing.

1603
01:45:21,120 --> 01:45:23,480
Logic can't make analogies.

1604
01:45:23,480 --> 01:45:29,520
It's a very bad thing to get stuck with.

1605
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:30,520
0 or 1?

1606
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:42,160
Maybe one of our papers should be on what

1607
01:45:42,160 --> 01:45:43,680
should AI do next year?

1608
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:48,000
9 o'clock.

1609
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:48,800
Thanks for coming.

1610
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:50,360
Thank you.
