8
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,680
I was curious.

9
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,960
How important do you think the understanding

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,520
of computational complexities and complexity theory

11
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,560
is to the understanding of intelligence

12
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,440
and the field of data?

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,960
That's a really, I can't remember

14
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,600
anybody asking that question.

15
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:56,200
What common sense questions are complex?

16
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:02,280
That would be a, yes?

17
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,480
One of the big insights you propose

18
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,480
is that the simplest problems that we solve

19
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,840
tend to be really complex.

20
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,280
I mean, there's different notions of complexity,

21
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,360
but in a certain way, let's say computation,

22
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,160
a lot of the simplest things like division and language

23
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,600
acquisition are probably much more complex

24
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,360
than a lot of the expertise and problems

25
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,120
that we usually talk about.

26
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:30,600
Yeah.

27
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,760
Have I shown this slide before?

28
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,920
It was published in the Toshiba Journal of Research

29
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,760
and Development, because I thought of it at some point

30
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,240
when I was in Japan.

31
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,280
Turn your microphone off.

32
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,480
I turned it off?

33
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,440
Yes.

34
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:07,840
I have some hot melt glue, which I could put my wallet

35
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,760
in the other pocket.

36
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:22,160
So this isn't complexity, but I think

37
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,360
I talked about this briefly.

38
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,320
The idea is this is one way of classifying problems,

39
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,640
and it's a very naive kind of complexity.

40
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:45,880
Namely, if you're trying to achieve some situation

41
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:53,640
or reach some goal, then what method should you use?

42
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:59,800
And so this is a cute little table

43
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,720
where you just count the number of inputs

44
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,280
and how much effect they have.

45
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:12,440
And I didn't bring a pointer either.

46
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,480
Oh, well.

47
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,800
Here's a pointer.

48
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,800
So if there are very few causes and each has a small effect,

49
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:26,840
then it's an easy problem.

50
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,280
I'm not sure of anything to say about it.

51
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,000
If you have a very large number of inputs to a situation

52
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,440
and each has a large effect, then it's probably hopeless,

53
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:45,760
because if there are n kinds of inputs

54
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,520
and they're all important, then you probably

55
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,800
have to exhaustively look at all 2 to the n cases

56
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,560
to be sure you haven't missed something.

57
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:02,640
And then here are eight areas of artificial intelligence

58
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,440
for intermediate situations.

59
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,200
So that's a kind of complexity.

60
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,040
But it doesn't say anything about how complex the problem

61
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,320
is, but just what kind of context

62
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:22,720
is in and how many inputs are involved.

63
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:31,320
So anyway, I'd like to see a better table

64
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:35,760
if anybody can think of what's another way of classifying

65
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,400
artificial intelligence problems.

66
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,360
And if you can think of one even dumber than this,

67
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,360
I'd be surprised.

68
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:54,280
However, if you look at recursive function theory,

69
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:59,040
then every now and then you run into some wonderful discovery,

70
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,040
like there's one that's attributed

71
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:12,800
to Friedberg and who was an undergraduate here, which

72
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:22,200
says that there are problems that there are some not

73
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,560
quite universal Turing machines which still have

74
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,320
unsolvable halting problems.

75
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,600
And these were constructed by sort

76
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,960
of mutilating two universal Turing machines that

77
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,600
are talking to each other and a lot of interesting partial

78
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:48,280
ordering mathematics, which I don't think I could reproduce.

79
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,320
So there is these wonderful theories

80
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:55,560
of algorithmic complexity.

81
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:01,320
How many of you have encountered that field?

82
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:05,480
There's a problem that quite a few.

83
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:09,800
My favorite problem is one that I worked on for months

84
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,560
and didn't solve.

85
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:23,920
And it was proposed by Emil Post in 1923,

86
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,440
I think.

87
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:36,660
He's a professor at NYU in New York University in New York.

88
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:44,280
And he had the idea of tag processes.

89
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:57,440
It's called tag because it's one process chasing another one

90
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,880
and trying to catch up.

91
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,840
And so the idea is you have some string of zeros and ones.

92
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,320
And the process that Emil Post studied,

93
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:18,220
and I wasted a lot of time on, was this.

94
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:24,180
You look at the first symbol in the string.

95
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:34,540
And if it's a 1, then you write 1101 at the end of the string.

96
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:42,100
But you cross off three of them.

97
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:56,980
And then if it's a 0, you write 00 and cross off three of them.

98
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,100
It's called the tag problem because you're

99
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:03,580
wondering if the front of it is going to catch up to the back.

100
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,360
And if there were equal numbers of zeros and ones,

101
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,400
then you'd see that sometimes you're adding three things,

102
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,080
four things, and sometimes you're adding two.

103
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,640
And you're always pulling off three.

104
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,760
So it's sort of crazy.

105
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,800
I don't know what got him interested

106
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,560
in that in the first place.

107
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,600
So this is bad.

108
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:36,760
It's going to be, oh, we're going to get a lot of 1101.

109
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:41,880
So it's getting longer if I cross out three at a time.

110
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:50,280
So if you start with various strings,

111
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,360
sometimes it gets pretty long.

112
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,840
And then it gets eaten away and disappears,

113
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,120
or almost disappears.

114
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:02,120
Or it keeps getting longer forever.

115
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,800
What's the third case?

116
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,760
The third case would be maybe it gets into a loop

117
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,520
where it stays the same.

118
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,520
If it ever gets back to repeating the same string,

119
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,320
then it'll do that forever.

120
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:20,600
So Post asked, is there any string

121
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,340
which will grow forever?

122
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:29,700
And a lot of people have simulated this as far as 10

123
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,020
to the 10th steps.

124
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:37,980
And they always grew, except for the ones

125
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,180
that stop pretty soon.

126
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,100
So no one knows the answer.

127
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,820
Is there an initial string that grows infinite?

128
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:53,460
If you want to waste a summer, try

129
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:58,740
to find either some good theory of that.

130
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:07,860
Anyway, it's not clear what is the significance of that one.

131
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:13,100
But it was discovered, partly by me,

132
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:17,060
that there were tag systems like this that were universal

133
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:22,420
and could be made to simulate any other machine.

134
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:25,700
The trouble is you have to use a sort of complicated coding

135
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:32,380
to encode the problem for a tag process and decode it again.

136
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:41,900
Anyway, that's an example of a nice computational complexity

137
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,520
problem that's still unsolved.

138
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:47,800
And one of you might get some sudden insight

139
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,680
and figure out how to.

140
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,360
Yes?

141
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,240
So you mentioned that you helped prove

142
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:58,320
that there were some universal tag systems.

143
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,720
This is the way that they showed that some 2D cellular

144
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,400
automata are universal by converting it to the tag.

145
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,680
It's pretty similar.

146
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:18,440
I'm trying to remember the one that I proved was universal.

147
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,920
It wasn't.

148
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,800
It's pretty simple.

149
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:29,080
But it involved just knocking off two each time.

150
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:34,360
But it had, I've forgotten how many symbols it needed.

151
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,560
Anyway, I don't think I know any interesting case

152
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,880
where computational complexity has actually

153
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,680
influenced any work on AI.

154
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,760
Have you ever seen any of this?

155
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,140
Recursive function theory is a very beautiful branch

156
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,040
of mathematics.

157
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,080
And it's great fun, sort of like geometry

158
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,440
in that it starts with almost nothing.

159
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:12,520
And there is quite a lot about it in my old book

160
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,560
on computation.

161
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:19,040
There's a bit in Kurtzweil's great big book.

162
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,440
But I'm not sure what.

163
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,440
Yeah?

164
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,800
So Watson seems to be a good system

165
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,440
to answer questions.

166
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:33,440
Why is there an AI division of what intelligent system is?

167
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,240
Because it seems that the computers that we have

168
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:41,320
and the intelligent systems that we have,

169
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,520
they are good to solve specific problems.

170
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,880
But did we divide the intelligence

171
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,720
into fields that we want to solve?

172
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,840
Because as you said, we have, I don't know,

173
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,240
intelligence maybe can be divided in several pieces.

174
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:01,640
And maybe we're not trying to solve these parts.

175
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:06,640
The Turing test says, oh, we need a machine that

176
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,600
wants to imitate the human intelligence or whatever.

177
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,120
But the human intelligence itself

178
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,760
is a bunch of things we can't, I don't know, solve

179
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,120
different problems.

180
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:25,480
And it seems that there is no division of the intelligence.

181
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,600
Always we are asking, do we have a system that

182
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,240
can achieve human intelligence?

183
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,600
But we don't divide this problem.

184
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,760
How can we solve this big problem

185
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:39,040
if we don't divide this problem into smaller problems which

186
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,920
people can tackle?

187
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,240
Well, there are lots of things that we

188
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:49,480
have programs for that people can't solve.

189
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,240
So I'm not sure that the word intelligence

190
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,640
makes much sense anymore.

191
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,600
It's like consciousness.

192
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,240
Maybe at any particular moment, you're

193
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:05,320
talking about five or 10 or 20 different things.

194
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:09,200
For example, Watson is very good at getting

195
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:14,520
the name of a movie actor from a few clues.

196
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:19,520
But can it do any common sense reasoning?

197
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,360
You've been studying it a bit, Henry.

198
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:30,800
I think it can a little bit, not to the extent that we like.

199
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,200
But Eric Euler, who was part of the Watson team,

200
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,440
and he's been working on common sense knowledge.

201
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,000
So I think he probably does have some capability,

202
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,240
but not a lot.

203
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,120
It'd be nice to know more about it.

204
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,880
I haven't read what they've published.

205
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:53,600
But the trouble is they're not in business for their health.

206
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,320
And why don't we divide intelligence,

207
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,160
the problem of intelligence, into some problems

208
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,040
and try to tackle them?

209
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,520
Well, there's Howard Gardner with his.

210
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:10,440
Like, they do, I don't know, vision, I don't know.

211
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,240
I mean, that's not like AI we should do, right?

212
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,000
No one's trying to solve everything at once.

213
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,480
People are working on specific subproblems.

214
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,400
Yeah, but are they integrated?

215
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,520
Are which integrated?

216
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:27,480
I mean, can we integrate these subsystems?

217
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,440
Eventually, hopefully, maybe.

218
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,800
Let's see here.

219
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,640
In what sense are people integrated?

220
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,160
No, no, no.

221
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,920
Can we integrate the subsystems?

222
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:45,880
Like, OK, somebody's solving, like, the problem of vision.

223
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,880
Well, they would have to know about each other,

224
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,640
what the other subsystems can do,

225
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,880
so that they would get an idea to make an estimation,

226
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,840
or for example, Watson would be able to decide,

227
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,960
oh, this is something that I cannot handle.

228
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,920
I have to give it to this other program.

229
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:05,640
So you need to have a good classification system

230
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:09,680
that the more sub-systems, they would be able to talk to each

231
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,240
other, so I don't know if that's helpful.

232
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,240
Yeah, that's what I try to approximate

233
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:21,840
with these critics, which you have a bunch of systems.

234
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:27,800
I guess we don't know much about how parallel things

235
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,920
are in the human brain.

236
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:35,640
But presumably, some particular small number of processes

237
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:39,600
are going on any time, maybe a large number

238
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:49,320
of very trivial processes like, well, I don't know what like.

239
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:58,880
But my picture of the integration in human psychology

240
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:04,400
is by having these critics, so that whatever processes are

241
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,880
going on, you have other processes that

242
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:12,920
don't understand the ones that are actually doing the work,

243
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:17,360
but have some superficial assessment,

244
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,840
like this one is using up half of my sugar,

245
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:26,720
or it's wasted a lot of time, and it

246
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,000
hasn't solved its quota of problems

247
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,080
in the last five minutes, or five seconds,

248
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,720
or who knows, 100 milliseconds.

249
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,800
In the early work of Newell and Simon,

250
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:47,200
they did lots of experiments with stopwatches and instruments

251
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:52,000
to see how long people took to react to things.

252
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,480
And they concluded that for a conscious operation,

253
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:03,600
by conscious, I mean something that a person might actually

254
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,360
have a word for and mention.

255
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,480
Because when they get them solving problems,

256
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,120
they train their subjects to keep talking all the time

257
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,320
about what they're doing.

258
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:23,440
And so Newell concluded that there

259
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:29,800
were some operations that took about a 30th of a second.

260
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:33,440
And those were things on the verge of what

261
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,660
we might call consciousness.

262
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:39,160
And that there must have been other operations that

263
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:43,160
were two or three milliseconds that the person couldn't

264
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,520
talk about.

265
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:51,040
But he was studying operations which we understand very well,

266
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,080
like how you add up columns of numbers

267
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,080
and just little arithmetic things,

268
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,200
and timing these people with stopwatches

269
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,840
for endless periods.

270
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:08,280
And so he found that if you ask somebody to how much is eight

271
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,620
and three, the person would say 11.

272
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:14,020
And another time later, you'd ask them

273
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,380
how much is three and eight.

274
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:22,500
And he discovered, Newell reports,

275
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:26,580
that it usually takes people noticeably longer

276
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:31,180
in milliseconds to say that three and eight is 11

277
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:34,060
than to say that eight and three and 11.

278
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:40,500
And he fitted this to data and concluded

279
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,620
that when you add three and eight, you go three,

280
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:48,620
and then you count up 24 milliseconds.

281
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:55,320
And he concluded that you're doing addition one at a time

282
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,620
in three millisecond chunks.

283
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:00,980
Well, that's sort of nutty.

284
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:03,940
If you do enough experiments, I guess you can prove anything.

285
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:12,580
But where is all this going?

286
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:20,620
I think the, well, what would Watson

287
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:24,060
need to understand why you can pull something with a string,

288
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,460
but you can't push it?

289
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:31,220
And it seems to me if you could find a story in which

290
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:36,060
a famous actor came to a terrible fate

291
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:39,620
because he was pushing a string instead of pulling it,

292
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:42,740
Watson would get that right away because it would be

293
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:46,660
at the top level of your description of the movie.

294
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:51,860
But the question is, how much progress

295
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:55,540
are they making toward ordinary common sense thinking

296
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,300
and reasoning?

297
00:20:56,300 --> 00:21:02,940
And I presume, as Henry Lieberman said,

298
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:07,100
if Eric Mueller is actually in the middle of that,

299
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:12,380
then they have a first class AI researcher

300
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,680
because he did a lot of interesting things

301
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:18,380
before he disappeared from view.

302
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:24,060
Any other?

303
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:28,900
Where else is anything on that scale happening?

304
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:32,820
I bet that's the largest AI program in the world,

305
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,900
except maybe there are a couple of secret ones

306
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,660
in the classified.

307
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,940
It would be nice to believe that there were something

308
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:46,540
like the RAND Corporation actually

309
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:50,900
doing exciting, profound things for the benefit of all of us.

310
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:55,940
But I think I mentioned that I used

311
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:59,780
to hang around there in the middle of the 1950s,

312
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:03,660
and it was full of wonderful basic research.

313
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:07,500
But then things gradually got classified.

314
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:19,940
Anyway, I'd like to see a few more diagrams like this,

315
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:25,380
just trying to make commonsensical classifications

316
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:35,100
of AI problems and maybe figuring out where people are.

317
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:38,500
Are there some fairly important basic problems

318
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:42,700
that nobody's working on because they just

319
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:54,540
haven't formulated them in a way that they

320
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,420
can get people to work on them?

321
00:22:56,420 --> 00:23:05,180
I look back at 1970, and here's a program

322
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:10,460
that has a bunch of assumptions about the physical world

323
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:21,020
and understands how to generate subgoals from goals

324
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:26,980
in various ways and keep track of things.

325
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:30,260
So everyone who's interested in AI

326
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:34,860
should read the PhD theses in the early 70s

327
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:44,060
by Jerry Sussman and Pat Winston and Terry Winograd.

328
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:50,820
And I'd say each of those theses has

329
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:56,900
maybe a dozen lines of research that nobody

330
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:05,260
has followed very far because, like any other field,

331
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:12,260
AI has run into large-scale global funding fads.

332
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:18,540
And there was a decade in which rule-based systems were

333
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,460
virtually the only thing people worked on,

334
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:24,900
and they discovered a certain amount.

335
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:28,300
So lots of rule-based systems are out there in the world

336
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,620
doing useful things.

337
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:39,580
They never got to make three or four levels of criticism

338
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:40,660
in those systems.

339
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:45,020
And so to me, that area sort of reached

340
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:48,220
a certain point of economic usefulness

341
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:54,260
but almost disappeared from the horizon of research.

342
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:01,380
What's that project called, ACT?

343
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:05,380
What's the big rule-based system project that I'm

344
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:07,500
asking Pat Winston there?

345
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,180
I'm not sure what you were talking about.

346
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:11,100
ACT-R, is that what you were talking about?

347
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:11,620
Yeah.

348
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:12,340
ACT-R, yeah.

349
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:15,180
That had a lot of people all over the country

350
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,340
sort of participating.

351
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,780
And I wonder if anything ever.

352
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:21,100
Well, it's a descendant of SOAR, which

353
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,820
is the other big production rule system.

354
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:24,580
That was in the Will Simons.

355
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:30,580
And they keep refining those and adding this and adding that.

356
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:35,220
But it doesn't seem to come up to the surface

357
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:40,300
and announce a breakthrough of any sort,

358
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,100
or at least I haven't heard of any.

359
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:46,220
Well, the problem is it's a little hard

360
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:49,620
to tell whether it's a cognitive architecture

361
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:53,220
or a bad programming language.

362
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,340
You mean in order to get it to do something,

363
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:59,100
they have to do something specifically for that?

364
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,860
So it didn't just fall out.

365
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:05,460
The programming language is pretty awkward.

366
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,940
And because it doesn't actually do anything by itself,

367
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,420
it is a programming language.

368
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:14,900
So is there anything comparable to that?

369
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:22,020
Are there any big rule-based systems which are not

370
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,300
a programming language?

371
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:30,260
After all, programming languages are just fancy things that say,

372
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,420
if this, do that.

373
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:33,940
So if you try to tell us something

374
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:36,740
deeper rather than a rule-based system in FORTRAN,

375
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:42,420
it's more of a mindset than a set of criteria.

376
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:51,100
Of course, this was written in Lisp, this Winograd thing.

377
00:26:52,060 --> 00:27:02,700
I don't know if one of the things about Lisp, which

378
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:08,220
is potentially important, is that the underlying language

379
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:13,740
is so simple that it's fairly easy to write programs in Lisp

380
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:17,580
that make up, that write programs in Lisp.

381
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:20,540
I think it's probably almost impossible to do

382
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:24,700
that in a language like C++, because there's

383
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,140
a compiler in the way.

384
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:31,060
And of course, you can have an operation saying,

385
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,580
compile what I just said.

386
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:48,980
But I doubt if one of the features of Terry Winograd's

387
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:52,660
program is that you could tell it to build something.

388
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:55,940
And then the course of building things,

389
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:58,940
you'd give it a goal, and it would generate subgoals.

390
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:03,460
And it could answer questions about why it did something.

391
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:06,780
So for example, if you built some sort of tower

392
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:12,620
and you asked it, why did you move the green block?

393
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:16,860
Winograd's program could articulate that and say,

394
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:24,220
I had to move it to clean the surface of the large red block

395
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:28,820
so that I could put this other thing on it.

396
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:34,740
And so there you had a program that, at one level,

397
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:37,780
it's full of rule-based rules.

398
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:43,460
But it only fires up a rule when it

399
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:50,060
has a goal and some knowledge base says,

400
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:54,740
a way to achieve that goal is to apply this transformation.

401
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:57,940
Then what Winograd's program did was

402
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:03,180
it kept a record of each of the goals that it had generated

403
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:06,180
and each of the subgoals for that goal

404
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:10,060
that it had generated in order to achieve it.

405
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:14,220
And then the great achievement, which

406
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:18,500
was that he got enough English language idioms

407
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,580
into the operating system for that,

408
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:25,740
that if you asked it a question about why it did something,

409
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:28,700
it would actually give the same answer

410
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:31,940
that a person or a child would on the whole.

411
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:44,300
So the question to ask is, if they did so much in 1970,

412
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:49,140
what happened in the 40 years since then?

413
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:53,580
And it's quite a mystery.

414
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:58,900
He had six graduate students who tried to improve the thing,

415
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:03,740
and they all changed their thesis and advisor

416
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,180
at some point.

417
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:07,900
Do you remember?

418
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:11,940
What's the explanation why this never went further?

419
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,700
Pat's thesis was in the same year.

420
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,860
I guess I think the explanation is, in part,

421
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:24,180
that the Bloch's world presented no serious representation

422
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:24,680
problems.

423
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:33,160
So moving from the Bloch's world to some other world,

424
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:36,160
you suddenly have to deal with all kinds of things

425
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:49,120
that the Bloch's world doesn't have, like I, you, and goals.

426
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,600
It didn't.

427
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,040
Emotional goals, things like that.

428
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:54,120
OK, there wasn't anything in the Bloch's world

429
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:54,960
that had goals.

430
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,040
Right.

431
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:01,600
Well, there should be something in between,

432
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,480
because you're going all the way to people

433
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,000
like Romeo and Juliet.

434
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,520
Have you tackled them, or are you in Macbeth?

435
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,520
I'm still in Shakespeare.

436
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:19,280
Mostly Macbeth and Helen, which was so parallel.

437
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:28,280
Of course, you could switch to Leonard Bernstein.

438
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:41,440
And what was that play called?

439
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,280
West Side Story.

440
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,320
West Side Story.

441
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,640
I was born on the west side, but it

442
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:52,480
didn't have any gangs then that are 86th Street.

443
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,740
Well.

444
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:14,960
So part of the topic, I guess you seem to think of tragedies.

445
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:18,000
I'm curious what makes the story easier or harder to analyze,

446
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
and why you picked the ones you didn't.

447
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Well, why do they pick the ones I did?

448
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I mean, Macbeth and Shakespeare, the stories.

449
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,480
Let's see.

450
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,480
There's an official answer and a real answer.

451
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,480
I'm not sure what the real answer is.

452
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,960
I've articulated the official answer so often,

453
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:47,440
I'm beginning to believe it.

454
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:54,440
But the official answer is that Shakespeare plots

455
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:58,440
have all the kinds of things you find in any human situation.

456
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:01,440
Or any situation that's even the situation

457
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,440
between organizations or countries.

458
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,440
You get everything.

459
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,920
You get the greed.

460
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,920
You get revenge.

461
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:14,880
You get all kinds of jealousies, threats, and all sorts

462
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,880
of things you would want to be able to deal with.

463
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,880
So that's the official answer.

464
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:23,880
The real answer is I kind of like those things.

465
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,880
And the plots are familiar to you,

466
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,880
so I didn't have to go out.

467
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,880
But it's really true.

468
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,880
If you take any of those Shakespearean plays,

469
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,880
they're all about the human condition in various ways.

470
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,840
And through three of them, you can cover a lot of ground.

471
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:45,840
And I'm presuming that if I can deal with the plot in Macbeth,

472
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,840
then I can deal with a lot of stuff.

473
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:55,840
You probably deal with a lot of other Shakespeare plays.

474
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,840
They run very similar.

475
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,840
If you look at the plot of Hamlet and Macbeth,

476
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,840
they're almost identical.

477
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:02,840
I sometimes forget who's who.

478
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:07,800
Did they all kill their mother?

479
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,800
They all had them.

480
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,800
The king was always killed by somebody

481
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,800
and killed by somebody else in revenge.

482
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,800
It was remarkably easy to see analogies.

483
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:28,800
Yes, it's been happening in the last months out in real life,

484
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,800
almost as though they read the stuff.

485
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:40,800
But now you're allowed to kill them with drones.

486
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,800
It's pretty serious.

487
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,800
Well, what would you like to see the AI people working on?

488
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,800
A robot baseball player?

489
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,800
We should finish up soccer first.

490
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:19,800
Is soccer hard?

491
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,800
It's harder than robots.

492
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,400
I was just talking to Hakey about this.

493
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,560
There was an AI researcher named Woodrow Bledsoe who

494
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:37,080
did some of the best early work in visual pattern recognition.

495
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:44,520
And he defeated all of us at ping pong.

496
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:52,880
And one day I asked him, how come you're so good at ping pong?

497
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:57,440
And he said, I don't think I'm any better than any of you,

498
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,400
except I look five steps ahead.

499
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:12,480
And we'll never know if he just made that up.

500
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,480
Yeah?

501
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:21,480
So you asked what AI people should work on every time.

502
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,480
So really classically, AI is studied

503
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,480
for linguistic capability.

504
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,480
And in recent times, we've been doing

505
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:33,400
that other senses should also be taking into account.

506
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,400
Vision for a long time has been included.

507
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,400
But I don't know, every time we talk about this,

508
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:40,400
I always think about, what about other senses?

509
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,400
Does anyone do anything with olfactory sense?

510
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,400
Because that can have a big effect on memory, right?

511
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:48,400
You can smell something and then have this memory that's

512
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,400
strongly associated with it.

513
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,400
So I think that probably a lot of senses

514
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:58,400
have something interesting about it.

515
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,320
Some interesting component of intelligence in them.

516
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:04,320
And I wonder if anyone just has done any of the,

517
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,320
if anyone has tried to touch at least on all the senses

518
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,820
and on what they could possibly achieve.

519
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:24,280
It's funny, because the olfactory thing,

520
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:27,800
I don't know what to say, because as far as I know,

521
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,720
it's just a bunch of chemical detectors.

522
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:35,000
But you could say that about almost anything, I suppose.

523
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Well, the interesting thing to me is they're all coupled.

524
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
So a smell can remind you of something

525
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,000
that you experienced 30 years ago.

526
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
And sometimes a memory can make you,

527
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
if you remember something, you can kind of

528
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
experience the smell, even though it might not exist.

529
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,720
Have you ever had that phenomenon?

530
00:37:54,720 --> 00:38:00,600
Some Microsoft researcher works on the sense of smell

531
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,400
in lobsters.

532
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:08,280
And he said that the organs are almost the same as in ours.

533
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:11,800
But of course, you can't say much about a system

534
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,800
from the primary detectors.

535
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,760
The question is what you do with the stuff.

536
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,200
Well, it seems to me that the important thing

537
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,760
about all the senses is that they give us some access.

538
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,960
They give us some mechanism that allows

539
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:31,400
us to build up a model of stuff that happens in the world.

540
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,520
So if you don't have vision, you substitute touch,

541
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:37,200
and you still get the idea that two solid objects can't

542
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:42,560
intersect each other, and things fall.

543
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,120
Yes, I know people who've lost their sense of smell.

544
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,920
There's some virus infections that do that.

545
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:59,560
And they miss it a bit, but they're not hugely handicapped.

546
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,060
What?

547
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:03,440
You can get a huge stomach ache.

548
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,040
If you eat the wrong thing?

549
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,880
Yeah, because then you'll start eating more than food.

550
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,600
So I guess you should be.

551
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:17,240
You make sure that the can isn't under pressure.

552
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:20,480
Yes, we make sure that you only buy things from supermarkets

553
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,640
that have sell-by gates in them.

554
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,440
Sell-by.

555
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,080
So maybe we won't have a sense of smell in 100 years.

556
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:34,680
I don't think anybody's built a good smell detector yet.

557
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:44,600
When people are trying to create soccer robots that play soccer,

558
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,760
I believe they have problems identifying the ball

559
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,080
if the lights are changing.

560
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,640
And I think that this is a big problem.

561
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:54,440
Do you believe that's a problem because the algorithms that we

562
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,840
have, they are bad?

563
00:39:55,840 --> 00:40:00,360
Or it's just like the sensory that we have is bad?

564
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:04,600
For example, Kinect, they used a different type of sensory

565
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:08,960
to see people, like 25 people.

566
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:14,880
Maybe it's just a problem with the sensory that we have.

567
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,080
Because the algorithms, they seem pretty good.

568
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:22,600
Is the Kinect the one that outlines your posture?

569
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,440
It's a great gadget.

570
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,800
Well, don't get me started on sports.

571
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:41,720
If you look at the world budget for various activities,

572
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:44,000
it adds up to more than 100%.

573
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,800
But how much?

574
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:53,400
What fraction of the gross world product

575
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:59,400
goes into sports and activities like that?

576
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:09,680
That gets back to the, what are we

577
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,280
going to do with all the people now

578
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,880
that we have 7 billion of them?

579
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:24,240
And I'm pretty sure that the biologists will find ways

580
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:33,680
to treat or slow down most of the degenerative diseases

581
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:40,480
in the next 50 years, say.

582
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,440
People should be living for about 200 years.

583
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:49,600
And what will we get them to do?

584
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,720
I just gave a lecture to some other people.

585
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:56,220
Wow.

586
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:16,840
And there's a scene in 2001 where the pod comes back

587
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,720
to the spaceship.

588
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:22,640
And it turns the handle on the door and opens the door.

589
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,960
And I was very impressed.

590
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:33,920
And the next time I saw Kubrick, I said,

591
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:37,280
how did he get the thing to actually work?

592
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:41,160
And he looked at me as though I were an idiot.

593
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:45,240
And he said, we did that with stop action.

594
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:50,520
And then somebody on the other side of the door

595
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,560
turned the doorknob.

596
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:01,600
But I would like to see better robots.

597
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:10,880
And something like this could be,

598
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,640
we could make these and throw them up to the moon.

599
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:21,040
And the idea here is, let's make a robot out

600
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:24,200
of very simple modules.

601
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:28,240
So you see, there's only two kinds of things here.

602
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:33,480
There are these hinges and these rods.

603
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:36,960
And they have some kind of motor in them.

604
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:42,480
And if we could fabricate them to be pretty reliable

605
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:50,240
and ship up a truckload of them and drop it on the moon,

606
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:54,280
and they could each have a solar cell or two,

607
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:56,920
because you don't mind if it takes

608
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:04,800
10 minutes to move a few inches, then the idea

609
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,160
is, if you had enough of these, like four or five,

610
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:11,160
then if any one of them broke, two of the others

611
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:15,160
could take it apart and fix it and replace the parts.

612
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:19,880
And for the price of one shuttle flight or two,

613
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:23,000
we could have robots on the moon for the next 20 years.

614
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,200
What are they doing instead?

615
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:33,400
They're still planning more manned space expeditions

616
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,360
at enormous expense.

617
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:43,720
And we may not see them in our lifetimes.

618
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:44,840
NASA is going.

619
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,800
As you can see, I don't have a lecture.

620
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,840
OK, but.

621
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:55,840
I've got a question.

622
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:58,800
So I was reading Sussman's Hackberg.

623
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:04,280
And I noticed that initially, the question that

624
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:08,560
was asked, and this is from GPS, Hacker, and NOAA,

625
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:13,640
and Interplan, was they attempted a theory of bugs.

626
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:16,760
But very soon, I noticed that the question

627
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:18,520
changed the planning.

628
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:21,680
And then just planning, in general, search and planning.

629
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,600
And then there was no mention of bugs.

630
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:27,120
There were ideas of critics and stories,

631
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:29,320
but that died in like 10 years.

632
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:32,520
And it seemed like the focus switched to planning.

633
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,480
And the thought I had was maybe it's

634
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:40,080
what question you ask dictates the direction in the next few

635
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:42,560
decades you're probably going to take.

636
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:49,080
And the question I had was, both in Push's thesis and in Hacker,

637
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,920
there's an attempt to build a library of critics.

638
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,000
So there are bugs.

639
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,240
There are patches in the library, which probably look up.

640
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:01,480
Given A representation, we have this library.

641
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:03,760
Maybe when we hit some threshold for this,

642
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,480
especially when we're moving from something

643
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:08,440
like a Blocks world to the real world,

644
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:10,540
if that library keeps growing, maybe it's

645
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:11,680
an expensive process.

646
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,440
Maybe we want to use that library

647
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:16,760
to create a new representation on the fly.

648
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:18,240
Does that make sense to you?

649
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,400
Well, of course, most representations

650
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,080
are worse than the one you have.

651
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:33,200
It's a great question.

652
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:37,600
How often, where do we get our representations?

653
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:44,440
Do teachers have the idea in grade school or nursery school

654
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,080
of what the children are doing?

655
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:54,680
And I'm not sure that we.

656
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:01,260
What do you learn in education school?

657
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:04,020
Is it still conditioned reflexes,

658
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:06,980
or is there some cognitive psychology?

659
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:13,860
And do modern cognitive psychology people

660
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:17,780
have anything like the representation theories

661
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:21,220
that AI people have?

662
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:22,980
The whole thing seems so muddy to me.

663
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:29,820
I asked the other day how many of you

664
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:33,060
have taken a psychology course.

665
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:36,660
It wasn't many, a few.

666
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:38,780
Do they talk about representations,

667
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:44,440
or are they still in the world of optical illusions

668
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:48,180
and conditioned reflexes and things like that?

669
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:51,180
They weren't supposed to find words to mean other words,

670
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:53,140
but aren't actually saying anything.

671
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:08,300
Well, I hope that gets back to the.

672
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:27,220
Well, representations, the idea that we all

673
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:33,420
learn about vectors, that's elementary physics nowadays,

674
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:38,580
the idea that vector calculus is only

675
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:45,820
from the time of Willard Gibbs, 1880.

676
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:46,940
Can you look up Gibbs?

677
00:48:46,940 --> 00:49:01,900
So how come humankind didn't invent a lot of mathematics

678
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:07,700
between the time of Archimedes and Gauss?

679
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:12,540
Gauss is about 1840, and there are

680
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:16,740
a bunch of mathematicians scattered in those periods.

681
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:24,780
But the modern representations in mathematics, most of them

682
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:27,420
are only about a century or a little more

683
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:28,500
than a century old.

684
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:38,380
So every child invents a lot of new representations,

685
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:40,860
but we don't know much about what they are.

686
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:53,500
I guess Piaget is the 1930s, the first psychologist

687
00:49:53,500 --> 00:50:00,180
to try to make effective theories

688
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:04,220
and prove them by experiments on young children,

689
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:05,820
figure out how they represent things.

690
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:09,540
Yeah?

691
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:11,380
The private computer in it says,

692
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:14,900
Gibbs developed vector analysis from 1880, 1884.

693
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:18,340
Isn't that something?

694
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:19,900
Now, what did Descartes do?

695
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:22,660
He got the coordinates.

696
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:25,380
Apparently, quaternions existed before then,

697
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:28,460
and some other outgrowth calculus.

698
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:31,660
Yeah, the quaternions were a beautiful dead end.

699
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:36,100
And if Hamilton had invented vectors instead,

700
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:39,460
he might not have been able to handle rotation so well.

701
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:43,940
But all the rest of physics would have been better off.

702
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:48,700
How many of you have ever used a quaternion?

703
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:54,700
For graphics?

704
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:02,340
They have amazing property that they only

705
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:04,860
work in three dimensions, too.

706
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:10,100
So they're no good for relativistic space-time

707
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:11,740
and things like that.

708
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:12,660
It's very strange.

709
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:22,820
Help?

710
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:23,860
Yeah?

711
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:24,660
STUDENT 1.

712
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:27,260
There's a study for taking newborn infant

713
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:30,740
and place them on a table top for the first time,

714
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:32,620
and they crawl to the edge.

715
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:33,820
They won't fall off.

716
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:35,380
They'll see the edge and crawl back.

717
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:36,940
They'll never see the edge.

718
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:41,380
Do you think this is either some innate representation,

719
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:45,940
some ability to model, and a primitive physics simulation

720
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:46,660
already happening?

721
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:50,340
Or do you think this is sort of a hard-coded edge detector?

722
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:51,460
Or are they just lucky?

723
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:59,900
Well, if you look at a mountain goat,

724
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:06,980
it gets born and drops out, and it

725
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:10,380
starts to walk in about five minutes,

726
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:13,180
and then it can follow its mother

727
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:15,620
and knows where to get milk.

728
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:18,780
And when it comes to a crevasse, I

729
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:20,300
get this from Seymour Papert.

730
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:23,140
I haven't seen it myself.

731
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:28,420
But the very first time the baby goat comes to a crevasse,

732
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:33,740
it goes up and around and comes down again.

733
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:39,340
The mother steps across, and the fairly newborn baby

734
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:42,260
is following her around.

735
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:42,780
STUDENT 1.

736
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:47,380
I don't think they know exactly where to go to get milk.

737
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:49,140
Maybe they use smell.

738
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:49,660
STUDENT 1.

739
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:53,620
I once saw a newborn goat go back and forth

740
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:57,580
between the front lines and the back lines.

741
00:52:57,580 --> 00:53:00,300
I once saw a newborn cocoa back and forth

742
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:02,300
between the front legs and the back legs.

743
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:05,340
I'm sure of exactly what you have to search for.

744
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:16,020
Somebody put this movie of a giraffe being born on the web.

745
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:18,300
And have you seen that recently?

746
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:22,580
It's just spectacular, because the things

747
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:25,780
are so incredibly awkward.

748
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:29,980
But after about 10 minutes, it keeps trying to get up.

749
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:33,900
And after about 10 minutes, it manages to get up and walk.

750
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:42,180
And sort of like juggling, it's really just about to fall over.

751
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:46,180
But anyway, so it looks clear that those things that

752
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:49,260
happened a few minutes after birth,

753
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:51,500
there hasn't been time for much trial and error.

754
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:56,180
But when you think about it, getting food

755
00:53:56,180 --> 00:53:59,020
is the most important thing in the universe.

756
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:02,900
And so you could afford to.

757
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:07,020
The system has to put priority on staying

758
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:09,220
alive for the first hour, so that you

759
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:11,060
can start to learn after that.

760
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:17,900
So still, it would be nice to know how those circuits work

761
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:19,620
and what is it that's built in.

762
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:31,300
And are your later learning mechanisms

763
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:34,860
mutated copies of the built-in ones at first?

764
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:48,400
Yes.

765
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:09,620
Is that still there?

766
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:10,120
No.

767
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:14,040
No.

768
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:19,380
How about a five-minute break?

769
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:26,220
I'm running out of voice.

770
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:28,700
There were a lot of discussions.

771
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:30,460
Anyone want to report on one?

772
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:46,900
We were talking to Sharad, and we were talking about bugs.

773
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:51,660
And when we talked about, I was describing a system

774
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:55,220
that one of my students, Alex Fay, worked on

775
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:59,140
that tried to understand bugs in web procedures,

776
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:01,980
like you were ordering on Amazon.

777
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:04,300
And it used common sense knowledge to say,

778
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:08,340
OK, the parts of the purchase are selection of the book,

779
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:10,860
maybe you want to buy, payment, delivery.

780
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:14,380
And then it said, OK, how do we tell if something went wrong?

781
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:17,700
And so then you could grade it down and say

782
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:19,900
that if the order got in correctly,

783
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:21,300
you would have got a receipt.

784
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:22,740
If the delivery happened, then you

785
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:24,260
would have got a FedEx tracking number,

786
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:27,420
and then the system could check these things automatically.

787
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:30,740
So in some sense, that's a little bit like Hacker,

788
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:32,860
having to catalyze with different bugs

789
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:35,460
and using common sense knowledge to break it down

790
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:38,700
and understanding if something went wrong.

791
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:41,780
So I think those are systems that

792
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:44,060
are kind of like end-user debugging,

793
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:45,780
so they're debugging without actually having

794
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:49,660
the program to be bugged.

795
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:51,460
So then we were talking more generally

796
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:55,780
about just the idea of building people's knowledge.

797
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:58,380
There was a lot of this AI stuff generated in the early days,

798
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:00,820
but nobody could have time to explore

799
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:02,180
all the consequences of it.

800
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:07,380
So a lot of things got lost, and certain things got trendy

801
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:10,500
and maybe not always the right things.

802
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:12,340
But still, there's a lot of stuff out there

803
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:13,940
that could be built on.

804
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:16,420
And part of doing interesting research

805
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:18,500
is understanding what's the really important stuff

806
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:20,340
to build on, even if other people don't

807
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:21,900
think it's fashionable.

808
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:27,820
And then you can be innovative by building on that stuff.

809
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:32,980
MARVIN MINSKY It's interesting if can you

810
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:36,140
think of problem solving as debugging,

811
00:57:36,140 --> 00:57:41,860
because sometimes people think of knowing

812
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:45,020
what to do and planning.

813
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:50,900
But if you think of that Newell and Simon general problem

814
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:57,300
solver, every step is, what's the difference between what

815
00:57:57,300 --> 00:58:00,140
I want and what I got?

816
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:03,660
And so you could think of the GPS as doing nothing

817
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:04,580
but debugging.

818
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:09,580
It's actually good at debugging, because if you get it off

819
00:58:09,580 --> 00:58:12,820
track, then it tells you how to repair it.

820
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:16,100
But a higher level one is, you might

821
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:19,140
have spent too much time debugging something

822
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:22,020
that was just a minor part.

823
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:24,420
Maybe if you fixed something else,

824
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:26,140
this bug wouldn't have happened anyway.

825
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:33,700
Is that a theory of problem solving?

826
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:36,300
Well, I think one important thing about problem solving

827
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:39,180
is keeping track of what depends on what.

828
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:41,860
So things like truth maintenance systems,

829
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:44,300
that's what they're all about, is trying to keep.

830
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:48,300
So if you know what depends on what,

831
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:51,540
then you can trace back for debugging.

832
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:06,540
Are there any systems?

833
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:17,580
Yes, what do companies do when they get complaints?

834
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:20,500
Do they have systems?

835
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:22,340
They have a phone call to India, and they tell you,

836
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:25,580
you can't help, they can't help you.

837
00:59:25,580 --> 00:59:29,620
They give you another number to call.

838
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:35,780
Funny story is that I had for one of the call to help

839
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:39,500
customers, went to India, and this person picked it up

840
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:41,660
and said, do you have this manual?

841
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:43,580
I said, yes, I do.

842
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:46,620
He said, could you look at this chapter and this section?

843
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:49,020
Okay.

844
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:51,580
And then they said, can you look for your problem

845
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:52,420
in that section?

846
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:54,500
And I said, great.

847
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:58,060
So after like 15 minutes, I ended up fixing it myself.

848
00:59:58,060 --> 00:59:59,460
Just didn't know where the manual was.

849
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:00,580
I could have done it myself.

850
01:00:00,580 --> 01:00:02,660
So sometimes that happens.

851
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:15,980
On that topic, does it make sense to ask how genes represent

852
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:18,300
mistakes?

853
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:19,180
Genes?

854
01:00:19,180 --> 01:00:19,660
Genes.

855
01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:29,180
Is there an idea of, is there an error in mutation or something?

856
01:00:29,180 --> 01:00:39,100
Well, of course, every gene that's selected

857
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:46,940
is selected because the parent managed

858
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:51,900
to solve some problem that the others didn't solve, I suppose.

859
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:56,580
That's a great question because I've been complaining

860
01:00:56,580 --> 01:00:59,980
that evolution has this big bug.

861
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:09,180
Namely, it doesn't remember why the losers died.

862
01:01:09,180 --> 01:01:14,140
So there are lots of minor bugs in the genetic system.

863
01:01:14,140 --> 01:01:16,820
And I think that's a great question.

864
01:01:17,820 --> 01:01:23,420
So there are lots of minor bugs in the genetic system.

865
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:24,460
You could call them bugs.

866
01:01:24,460 --> 01:01:29,620
But when you have a population of animals

867
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:34,020
and it gets too cold, then some of them

868
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:42,820
die out because they didn't eat enough before it got cold

869
01:01:42,820 --> 01:01:45,060
or whatever.

870
01:01:45,060 --> 01:01:50,580
And evolution doesn't keep any record of that.

871
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:52,460
But on the other hand, you could say

872
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:55,500
that all the genes you do have are

873
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:57,300
ones that corrected some bug.

874
01:02:00,540 --> 01:02:05,940
So in that sense, it remembers how to solve the bugs,

875
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:08,140
but it doesn't remember what the bugs were.

876
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:18,580
So could you make an evo- But to make an evolutionary system

877
01:02:18,580 --> 01:02:25,780
that kept records of why the losers died,

878
01:02:25,780 --> 01:02:30,220
wouldn't that take a higher level language or something?

879
01:02:30,220 --> 01:02:32,540
Maybe there's no way to evolve such a system.

880
01:02:33,540 --> 01:02:38,980
I mean, could have a system that reversed engineers

881
01:02:38,980 --> 01:02:45,740
based on what did survive, what the mistakes were?

882
01:02:45,740 --> 01:02:49,340
You could have to think, keep two copies of the genomes.

883
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:54,140
And when you have children, you have one of each.

884
01:02:54,140 --> 01:03:00,180
And well, it's too complicated.

885
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:03,380
So when we make artificial evolution,

886
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:06,740
we can probably make the thing millions of times

887
01:03:06,740 --> 01:03:15,300
more efficient by keeping a moderate size

888
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:21,140
record of what caused fatalities.

889
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:25,380
Of course, that's what medical records are for,

890
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:28,620
but they don't get back into the genetic system yet.

891
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:34,180
Doesn't that depend a lot on text?

892
01:03:34,180 --> 01:03:37,580
For instance, something may be beneficial during an ice age.

893
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:40,060
But if you institutionalize that,

894
01:03:40,060 --> 01:03:42,180
then when you're living in a tropical jungle,

895
01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:44,980
it could be to your detriment.

896
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:49,820
I was just thinking of ice age because of what's-his-name's

897
01:03:49,820 --> 01:03:50,340
book.

898
01:03:55,620 --> 01:03:58,620
So you'd have to keep copies for millions of years

899
01:03:58,620 --> 01:04:03,300
and store all the descriptions of environments.

900
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:05,860
Or else you have that same genetic mutation

901
01:04:05,860 --> 01:04:07,420
occurring over periods of time.

902
01:04:07,420 --> 01:04:09,980
And when it's beneficial, you keep it.

903
01:04:09,980 --> 01:04:12,500
And when the circumstances aren't right for it,

904
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:14,260
then it goes away with the idea that it might

905
01:04:14,260 --> 01:04:15,980
be able to come back later.

906
01:04:15,980 --> 01:04:17,660
So that's, in fact, what we do when

907
01:04:17,660 --> 01:04:21,300
we have historians and society.

908
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:24,100
And it might not make any sense to try

909
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:29,860
to build it into a low-level genetic system.

910
01:04:29,860 --> 01:04:33,340
Just carry books around.

911
01:04:33,340 --> 01:04:37,820
Well, how long will we be able to read those books?

912
01:04:37,820 --> 01:04:41,460
Because a language from 1,000 years ago

913
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:51,620
is still, I think, only specialized people can read

914
01:04:51,620 --> 01:04:56,540
very, very old Germanic languages, for example.

915
01:04:56,540 --> 01:04:59,580
Modern English speakers cannot, for certain.

916
01:04:59,580 --> 01:05:03,860
So all of our interpretation of those old texts

917
01:05:03,860 --> 01:05:09,180
that were how to avoid people who come at you with bears

918
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:16,820
or swans or whatever have evolved as well.

919
01:05:16,820 --> 01:05:19,660
How does the technology work?

920
01:05:19,660 --> 01:05:23,620
The culture or is it an important place?

921
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:25,820
Well, I think things like the iPad are going to.

922
01:05:28,820 --> 01:05:32,820
I was just thinking, my wife was involved

923
01:05:32,820 --> 01:05:35,780
with some children who were carrying

924
01:05:35,780 --> 01:05:43,100
30% of their weight in books in elementary school.

925
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:45,140
It's incredible how heavy.

926
01:05:45,340 --> 01:05:47,660
They don't even have wheels on their book bag.

927
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:04,820
But we could re-engineer the nervous system

928
01:06:04,820 --> 01:06:07,100
to have gigabytes of storage.

929
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:10,340
And then evolution could keep lots of records.

930
01:06:10,540 --> 01:06:13,860
And then evolution could keep lots of records.

931
01:06:35,540 --> 01:06:38,460
I want to know what was being said up there.

932
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:40,820
Is anyone?

933
01:06:40,820 --> 01:06:42,020
Were you talking to Pat?

934
01:06:46,180 --> 01:06:49,780
A little bit about complexity and also

935
01:06:49,780 --> 01:06:55,540
about storytelling, just some current topics

936
01:06:55,540 --> 01:06:57,820
and what his lab is working on.

937
01:06:57,820 --> 01:07:02,620
For example, how can you teach if you're going to?

938
01:07:02,620 --> 01:07:06,020
People have different models.

939
01:07:06,020 --> 01:07:11,460
So any understating assumptions, something

940
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:13,260
that you might be taking as propaganda

941
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:19,900
or maybe taking something for a less malicious way.

942
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:21,260
What time is his class?

943
01:07:21,260 --> 01:07:24,140
I think I should be sitting in on it.

944
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:24,780
I'm not sure.

945
01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:26,540
Except before I'm not sure.

946
01:07:26,540 --> 01:07:29,340
Monday, Wednesday, Friday, 10 AM.

947
01:07:29,340 --> 01:07:30,260
It's not so bad.

948
01:07:36,020 --> 01:07:37,500
Yeah.

949
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:39,220
What?

950
01:07:39,220 --> 01:07:41,020
Lectures are only Monday and Wednesday.

951
01:07:41,020 --> 01:07:44,300
And then Friday, there's a problem solving session.

952
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:46,980
It started out, so Fridays were lectures.

953
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:50,060
And then we used to do less lectures at the end.

954
01:07:50,060 --> 01:07:53,700
But there's not much left, so.

955
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:55,060
That's the way it always seems.

956
01:08:06,020 --> 01:08:06,520
Yeah?

957
01:08:15,460 --> 01:08:17,460
Yeah?

958
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:20,460
So I missed a lecture last week.

959
01:08:20,460 --> 01:08:24,460
Did we talk about maybe interesting past projects

960
01:08:24,460 --> 01:08:26,420
for the class?

961
01:08:26,420 --> 01:08:29,420
We didn't.

962
01:08:29,420 --> 01:08:33,540
Maybe can you think of some good ones?

963
01:08:33,540 --> 01:08:35,340
I guess Justin isn't here tonight.

964
01:08:39,860 --> 01:08:41,660
I hate to say it, but the best projects

965
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:44,340
were in the days when you could have

966
01:08:44,340 --> 01:08:47,620
an incomplete for a whole year.

967
01:08:52,220 --> 01:08:56,940
I think now it's, what is it, the third week of the next term?

968
01:08:56,940 --> 01:08:57,440
Yeah.

969
01:09:00,780 --> 01:09:04,940
Yeah, I had some great papers that came a year later.

970
01:09:04,940 --> 01:09:08,140
But somebody in the administration

971
01:09:08,140 --> 01:09:11,420
decided that incompletes had to be completed.

972
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:22,460
Have you seen any good projects?

973
01:09:22,460 --> 01:09:26,740
Because nobody's written them yet.

974
01:09:27,140 --> 01:09:27,980
The term project.

975
01:09:37,620 --> 01:09:40,940
I'll try to find some from previous years.

976
01:09:40,940 --> 01:09:43,260
Maybe we can get permission to make a book of them.

977
01:09:43,260 --> 01:09:56,500
The other thing to be focused on,

978
01:09:56,500 --> 01:10:00,100
there seems to be a preference for some engineering

979
01:10:00,100 --> 01:10:05,020
deliverables as well, like some code or program.

980
01:10:05,020 --> 01:10:06,140
Not necessarily.

981
01:10:06,260 --> 01:10:06,760
Hi.

982
01:10:11,940 --> 01:10:14,460
Well, there was a year or two when

983
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:17,780
Bo Morgan was one of the TAs, and he

984
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:21,100
was developing a programming language

985
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:26,660
and wanted to get people to do projects in that language.

986
01:10:26,660 --> 01:10:30,180
But it wasn't such a good idea, because he

987
01:10:30,180 --> 01:10:31,500
kept changing the language.

988
01:10:36,140 --> 01:10:36,640
Yeah.

989
01:10:44,660 --> 01:10:45,980
What's the best language?

990
01:10:56,420 --> 01:10:59,620
Well, if you're going to, yeah, if you're going to have, which?

991
01:11:00,460 --> 01:11:00,940
Vigour.

992
01:11:03,940 --> 01:11:07,220
If you're going to have reflective thinking,

993
01:11:07,220 --> 01:11:13,500
then can you do it with the same language at each level?

994
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:24,100
Because if you don't, how many words were there in Latin?

995
01:11:24,100 --> 01:11:25,500
Is it a big language?

996
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:27,380
Depends on how you count.

997
01:11:27,380 --> 01:11:28,740
If you count all the conjugations,

998
01:11:28,740 --> 01:11:30,780
that would be two or nine to two, right there.

999
01:11:38,580 --> 01:11:45,780
When I graduated from Harvard, you had a choice of a BA or a BS,

1000
01:11:45,780 --> 01:11:50,900
and you could get a BA if you had credit in Latin, which

1001
01:11:50,900 --> 01:11:52,340
I had from grade school.

1002
01:11:53,140 --> 01:11:57,900
But I never understood a word of it, hardly.

1003
01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:06,340
People said, if you learn Latin, then it

1004
01:12:06,340 --> 01:12:10,940
will be easier for you to learn French and Spanish and Italian

1005
01:12:10,940 --> 01:12:12,260
and all of those.

1006
01:12:14,660 --> 01:12:17,300
And after a while, I suddenly realized

1007
01:12:17,380 --> 01:12:21,580
that if I had learned French or Spanish or Italian,

1008
01:12:21,580 --> 01:12:23,580
then it would be easier to learn Latin.

1009
01:12:26,340 --> 01:12:28,460
I confronted the teachers with that,

1010
01:12:28,460 --> 01:12:30,340
and they had no good answer.

1011
01:12:36,740 --> 01:12:38,500
And besides, it should have been Greek,

1012
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:43,700
because Latin is full of pretty good stuff,

1013
01:12:43,700 --> 01:12:46,460
but it's not the only thing that's good.

1014
01:12:47,420 --> 01:12:48,980
Greek has Aristotle.

1015
01:12:57,860 --> 01:12:58,860
Yeah?

1016
01:12:58,860 --> 01:13:00,900
I know Latin pretty well.

1017
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:03,700
The thing I find it most practically useful for

1018
01:13:03,700 --> 01:13:06,540
is I'm taking intro to neuroscience,

1019
01:13:06,540 --> 01:13:08,460
and there's a lot of different neuroscience

1020
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:10,260
where you have to memorize all of them.

1021
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:12,740
And almost all are from Latin.

1022
01:13:12,740 --> 01:13:16,220
And so I can memorize them based on associations

1023
01:13:16,220 --> 01:13:17,460
like dorsal.

1024
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:21,300
Oh, I know that means back, so I know that's the back direction.

1025
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:23,060
And like every word, I only remember

1026
01:13:23,060 --> 01:13:24,980
because I know what it means.

1027
01:13:24,980 --> 01:13:26,740
Otherwise, just having to memorize the words

1028
01:13:26,740 --> 01:13:28,740
would be way more hard.

1029
01:13:28,740 --> 01:13:36,100
That reminds me of, I guess it's my wife Gloria

1030
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:42,460
is a physician, and she once had a Greek patient, I think.

1031
01:13:47,140 --> 01:13:51,980
And the patient said, what's wrong with me?

1032
01:13:51,980 --> 01:13:56,260
And she said, you have gastroenteritis.

1033
01:13:56,260 --> 01:13:58,540
And he said, I know that, but what's wrong with me?

1034
01:14:01,740 --> 01:14:09,620
And she realized that that was a non-diagnosis

1035
01:14:09,620 --> 01:14:13,260
that doctors use to make themselves feel

1036
01:14:13,260 --> 01:14:14,620
that they know what's happening.

1037
01:14:16,220 --> 01:14:28,420
So have you used it ever?

1038
01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:30,260
The Latin.

1039
01:14:30,260 --> 01:14:32,340
I mean, I use it for my just description.

1040
01:14:32,340 --> 01:14:35,380
I also, I mean, I don't think things

1041
01:14:35,380 --> 01:14:39,380
need to have practical value to have utility.

1042
01:14:39,380 --> 01:14:40,740
I enjoy reading Latin.

1043
01:14:44,140 --> 01:14:45,860
Well, what are the best stories?

1044
01:14:45,900 --> 01:14:50,020
Are there any good plays in ancient Latin?

1045
01:14:50,020 --> 01:14:51,660
There are some, yeah.

1046
01:14:51,660 --> 01:14:53,020
Mostly reading poetry.

1047
01:14:56,860 --> 01:14:59,540
Poetry.

1048
01:14:59,540 --> 01:15:00,820
But they don't rhyme, do they?

1049
01:15:00,820 --> 01:15:02,460
Because the endings are all the same.

1050
01:15:02,460 --> 01:15:04,940
Yeah, they generally don't rhyme.

1051
01:15:04,940 --> 01:15:05,940
But it's called poetry.

1052
01:15:05,940 --> 01:15:07,780
They're very strict meterless.

1053
01:15:07,780 --> 01:15:08,300
OK.

1054
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:17,220
A fair amount of the society of mind is in iambic tetrameter.

1055
01:15:20,180 --> 01:15:25,500
I just found it was easier to think rhythmically sometimes.

1056
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:26,820
It's very strange.

1057
01:15:26,820 --> 01:15:30,660
I'm not sure it does any.

1058
01:15:30,660 --> 01:15:32,300
If you don't know that there's a meter,

1059
01:15:32,300 --> 01:15:35,900
it certainly doesn't help understanding anything.

1060
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:42,100
But I guess in poetry, if you're skillful,

1061
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:46,860
then you're seeing analogies because the emphasis,

1062
01:15:46,860 --> 01:15:51,620
emphases are in similar places in different sentences.

1063
01:15:51,620 --> 01:15:57,940
So you're constructing a network of similarities

1064
01:15:57,940 --> 01:16:00,380
beyond the meanings of the words,

1065
01:16:00,380 --> 01:16:04,100
just from the places where the meter hits.

1066
01:16:06,220 --> 01:16:12,460
Like this rap is very popular.

1067
01:16:12,460 --> 01:16:20,300
And that's Alexander Pope.

1068
01:16:20,300 --> 01:16:24,020
Have any of you looked at any of him?

1069
01:16:24,020 --> 01:16:26,700
It's all couplets, rhyming couplets.

1070
01:16:26,700 --> 01:16:32,940
And it's exactly like rap, except without the bad music.

1071
01:16:32,940 --> 01:16:33,460
Oh, well.

1072
01:16:35,900 --> 01:16:45,820
A little earlier, we speculated that pre-engineering

1073
01:16:45,820 --> 01:16:47,980
can bring in gigabytes of memory.

1074
01:16:47,980 --> 01:16:50,500
And to some extent, we already have that

1075
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:53,820
with very slow lookup times.

1076
01:16:53,820 --> 01:16:57,420
So I was wondering if you had any commentary

1077
01:16:57,420 --> 01:17:01,540
on how we could improve artwork tools, computers or otherwise,

1078
01:17:01,540 --> 01:17:05,260
to help people solve problems and be more intelligent.

1079
01:17:05,260 --> 01:17:06,660
Do you think these are proceeding

1080
01:17:06,660 --> 01:17:07,700
in the right direction?

1081
01:17:07,700 --> 01:17:09,700
Do you think there's other areas of innovation

1082
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:10,460
that are lacking?

1083
01:17:15,060 --> 01:17:18,340
Well, I think the web is evolving.

1084
01:17:18,340 --> 01:17:21,740
Things like Google are getting to be quite remarkable.

1085
01:17:21,740 --> 01:17:30,740
And lately, I've been using the Dragon query language.

1086
01:17:30,740 --> 01:17:35,860
And the things are remarkable.

1087
01:17:42,540 --> 01:17:45,740
If you ask Dragon a question, it goes to Google

1088
01:17:45,740 --> 01:17:48,380
and makes up a pretty good query.

1089
01:17:48,380 --> 01:17:54,580
And just about every time I've tried it in recent weeks,

1090
01:17:54,580 --> 01:17:59,900
the answer to, where is the biggest island

1091
01:17:59,900 --> 01:18:03,300
with a volcano or blah, blah, whatever it is,

1092
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:05,380
it comes right up on the first page.

1093
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:14,740
So I suppose that there will be some very crude thing sometime

1094
01:18:14,740 --> 01:18:20,020
in the next decades where you put a bunch of sensors

1095
01:18:20,020 --> 01:18:24,700
over one of the speech are
[01:24:48.680 --> 01:24:50.680]  The ocean?
[01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:52.520]  Other side of what?
[01:24:52.520 --> 01:24:54.440]  On the other side of Mecca, the ocean.
[01:24:54.440 --> 01:24:55.840]  Yeah, yeah, so I was just thinking
[01:24:55.840 --> 01:25:02.160]  that there is a point where Mecca is in all directions.
[01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:07.040]  And how can you then go, OK, maybe I should go there?
[01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:10.440]  That's not true, because within the face of YQ,
[01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:12.680]  there is an integrity inside.
[01:25:12.680 --> 01:25:17.800]  I think wherever you are, the probability is about 80%
[01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:19.360]  that the opposite is ocean.
[01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:22.120]  Unless you're in the ocean.
[01:25:22.120 --> 01:25:23.520]  Well, it's still 80%.
[01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:28.120]  This is a water planet.
[01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:43.040]  We could make a little gun that just pops them up there,
[01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:47.080]  and it would take them weeks to get maintenance done.
[01:25:47.080 --> 01:25:50.120]  It would take them weeks to get maintenance to remove it.
[01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:16.280]  Do you think nobody wants to watch something in Aspen?
[01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:17.680]  I haven't heard any reports.
[01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:26.960]  Hey, could we get Eric Muller to give us a talk?
[01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:45.200]  Well, we could invite him to give a different talk,
[01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:46.520]  and then ask questions.
[01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:53.400]  It's been 8.59 for a whole minute.
[01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:01.040]  There's still time for a question.
[01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:02.320]  No, nope.
[01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:07.560]  Thank you.
8,720 --> 01:20:22,760
that you can't do with a hand.

1119
01:20:22,760 --> 01:20:24,840
Of course, two hands is better than.

1120
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:33,080
But I think getting outputs from the brain

1121
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:36,280
to go into memory devices and feeding them back

1122
01:20:36,280 --> 01:20:39,040
into the brain, that's going to become

1123
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:42,440
commonplace at some point.

1124
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:49,200
But we first have to find out how to do it at all,

1125
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:53,360
and then how to implant these things without a big operation

1126
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:55,360
and infection risk and all that.

1127
01:20:58,240 --> 01:20:59,240
Yeah?

1128
01:20:59,240 --> 01:21:01,720
People currently are burdened with these implants

1129
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:05,840
where they get magnets installed near their ankles.

1130
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:09,480
People get magnets installed near their ankles.

1131
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:13,720
So they can start feeling.

1132
01:21:13,720 --> 01:21:16,960
They feel slightly when there's a magnetic attraction

1133
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:19,520
between the magnets in their legs and something.

1134
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:23,000
And so they start developing a sort of magnetic sense.

1135
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,480
And then apparently, people report

1136
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:27,560
that even if they get these magnets removed,

1137
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:30,600
they still sort of retain the magnetic sense,

1138
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:32,240
which is pretty weird.

1139
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:34,680
Sounds weird.

1140
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:37,680
Can they tell which way is north?

1141
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:38,800
I don't think so.

1142
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:41,560
I think they can tell when they're around objects

1143
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:44,640
that the magnets will be attracted to.

1144
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:54,360
You certainly could make a magnetic sensor

1145
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:59,920
and put it anywhere in the body connected

1146
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:02,080
to a couple of nerves.

1147
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:04,680
And then you'd know which way is north all the time.

1148
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:05,640
Do you remember?

1149
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:07,480
People who made a belt with a compass

1150
01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:10,440
and it had a bunch of solenoids in it,

1151
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:13,760
and it sort of poked you at whatever part of your waist

1152
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:15,320
was pointed north.

1153
01:22:15,320 --> 01:22:18,320
After a while, people would sort of no longer

1154
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:20,880
notice the poking and just know which way is north.

1155
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:21,400
Oh.

1156
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:25,480
And sort of get incorporated, in a sense.

1157
01:22:25,480 --> 01:22:28,920
My friend Oliver Selfridge, who died recently,

1158
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:32,920
was a pioneer in cybernetics and AI.

1159
01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:34,760
And he always knew where north was.

1160
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:43,840
And it turned out, I traveled around with him some.

1161
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:49,760
And whenever he went in a building after a while,

1162
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:52,640
and he always knew where north was,

1163
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:58,640
but I noticed that he would always go into some office

1164
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:05,160
with a window and straighten out the secretary's flowers.

1165
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:09,520
He knew the names of all flowers, also in Latin.

1166
01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:16,160
So apparently, he felt uneasy when

1167
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:19,040
he was losing track of direction.

1168
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:20,880
And he'd go to a window.

1169
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:22,560
And before he went in a building,

1170
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:26,000
he'd memorize the big features.

1171
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:26,520
So.

1172
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:36,600
Did it work in this building, because I always get lost?

1173
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:44,200
I had the idea of chiseling little arrows pointing north.

1174
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:45,920
Are there any vandals among us?

1175
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:50,040
It would really be useful.

1176
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:52,440
The Muslims never get lost, because they always

1177
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:54,880
know which direction they're going.

1178
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:55,560
The bud?

1179
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:58,560
The Muslims never get lost, because they

1180
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:00,560
know always which direction the neck is.

1181
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:04,640
Oh, right.

1182
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:08,400
Yes, I think there should be little arrows pointing north

1183
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:09,080
in every room.

1184
01:24:09,080 --> 01:24:11,720
The first time I visited a Muslim country,

1185
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:13,800
I noticed that every time I stayed in a hotel room,

1186
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:16,240
there was an arrow on the ceiling of the hotel room.

1187
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:19,560
Oh, on the ceiling?

1188
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:20,320
On the ceiling, yes.

1189
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:22,760
Where you can't raise it.

1190
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:24,680
Yeah.

1191
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:27,160
And if that's the way it told you, we'd echo it.

1192
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:28,080
We could do that.

1193
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:35,720
In fact, if we had a point to Mecca instead of north,

1194
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:37,720
then nobody could criticize us.

1195
01:24:37,720 --> 01:24:38,220
Right.

1196
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:46,240
So what's exactly the opposite of Mecca?

1197
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:48,680
What's on the other side of Mecca?

1198
01:24:48,680 --> 01:24:50,680
The ocean?

1199
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:52,520
Other side of what?

1200
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:54,440
On the other side of Mecca, the ocean.

1201
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:55,840
Yeah, yeah, so I was just thinking

1202
01:24:55,840 --> 01:25:02,160
that there is a point where Mecca is in all directions.

1203
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:07,040
And how can you then go, OK, maybe I should go there?

1204
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:10,440
That's not true, because within the face of YQ,

1205
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:12,680
there is an integrity inside.

1206
01:25:12,680 --> 01:25:17,800
I think wherever you are, the probability is about 80%

1207
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:19,360
that the opposite is ocean.

1208
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:22,120
Unless you're in the ocean.

1209
01:25:22,120 --> 01:25:23,520
Well, it's still 80%.

1210
01:25:26,760 --> 01:25:28,120
This is a water planet.

1211
01:25:38,240 --> 01:25:43,040
We could make a little gun that just pops them up there,

1212
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:47,080
and it would take them weeks to get maintenance done.

1213
01:25:47,080 --> 01:25:50,120
It would take them weeks to get maintenance to remove it.

1214
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:16,280
Do you think nobody wants to watch something in Aspen?

1215
01:26:16,280 --> 01:26:17,680
I haven't heard any reports.

1216
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:26,960
Hey, could we get Eric Muller to give us a talk?

1217
01:26:39,680 --> 01:26:45,200
Well, we could invite him to give a different talk,

1218
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:46,520
and then ask questions.

1219
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:53,400
It's been 8.59 for a whole minute.

1220
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:01,040
There's still time for a question.

1221
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:02,320
No, nope.

1222
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:07,560
Thank you.
